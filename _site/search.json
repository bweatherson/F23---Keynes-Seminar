    "text": "I’m doing a seminar on John Maynard Keynes this fall (i.e., Fall 2023), at the University of Michigan. And because I’m old-fashioned, I thought I’d have a blog for the seminar. Apparently blogs these days have pictures, so here’s a famous picture of Keynes.\n\n\n\n1934 Cartoon of Keynes by David Low\n\n\nI’m a philosopher, and this is a philosophy seminar, so the course will be primarily about things that are philosophy in some very broad sense. We’re not going to get into the details of the Clearing Union, for example. But one thing I want to do with the seminar is stress how many different ways there are to be a philosopher, so we’ll stretch the limits a little bit of what is sometimes covered in philosophy. Still, a big focus will be on Keynes’s main work that is unquestionably an important philosophical work, the Treatise on Probability.\nHere is the tentative schedule for the seminar, which is very much subject to chage.\n\nTentative schedule for Keynes seminar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDate\nReading\n\n\n\n\n1\nAugust 28, 2023\nNone (intro)\n\n\nOff\nSeptember 4, 2023\nNone (Labor Day)\n\n\n2\nSeptember 11, 2023\nMy Early Beliefs.\nEconomic Possibilities for our Grandchildren.\n\n\n3\nSeptember 18, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 1-3\n\n\n4\nSeptember 25, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 4-5\n\n\n5\nOctober 2, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 6-9\n\n\n6\nOctober 9, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 18-20 (maybe also 21-23 if time)\n\n\nOff\nOctober 16, 2023\nNone (Fall Break)\n\n\n7\nOctober 23, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Ch. 26\nBroad’s review of TP\n\n\n8\nOctober 30, 2023\nCritics of TP: Edgeworth, Ramsey, Feigl\n\n\n9\nNovember 6, 2023\nGeneral Theory Chs. 1, 2, 24 (23, optional)\n\n\n10\nNovember 13, 2023\nGeneral Theory.
