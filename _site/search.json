    "text": "I’m doing a seminar on John Maynard Keynes this fall (i.e., Fall 2023), at the University of Michigan. And because I’m old-fashioned, I thought I’d have a blog for the seminar. Apparently blogs these days have pictures, so here’s a famous picture of Keynes.\n\n\n\n1934 Cartoon of Keynes by David Low\n\n\nI’m a philosopher, and this is a philosophy seminar, so the course will be primarily about things that are philosophy in some very broad sense. We’re not going to get into the details of the Clearing Union, for example. But one thing I want to do with the seminar is stress how many different ways there are to be a philosopher, so we’ll stretch the limits a little bit of what is sometimes covered in philosophy. Still, a big focus will be on Keynes’s main work that is unquestionably an important philosophical work, the Treatise on Probability.\nHere is the tentative schedule for the seminar, which is very much subject to change.\n\nI want to do four things with the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDate\nReading\n\n\n\n\n1\nAugust 28, 2023\nNone (intro)\n\n\nOff\nSeptember 4, 2023\nNone (Labor Day)\n\n\n2\nSeptember 11, 2023\nMy Early Beliefs.\nEconomic Possibilities for our Grandchildren.\n\n\n3\nSeptember 18, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 1-3\n\n\n4\nSeptember 25, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 4-5\n\n\n5\nOctober 2, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 6-9\n\n\n6\nOctober 9, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 18-20 (maybe also 21-23 if time)\n\n\nOff\nOctober 16, 2023\nNone (Fall Break)\n\n\n7\nOctober 23, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Ch. 26\nBroad’s review of TP\n\n\n8\nOctober 30, 2023\nCritics of TP: Edgeworth, Ramsey, Feigl\n\n\n9\nNovember 6, 2023\nGeneral Theory Chs. 1, 2, 24 (23, optional)\n\n\n10\nNovember 13, 2023\nGeneral Theory.

Keynes works at a time and place that is often taken to be a turning point in the history of philosophy. I think his work represents a kind of path not taken for philosophy. There is a possible world where moral and political philosophy, and perhaps even political economy more broadly, is just as central to twentieth century Anglophone philosophy as it was to nineteenth century Anglophone philosophy. Just how and why that didn’t happen is I think an interesting question, and looking at Keynes is possibly one interesting way into it. But it would require someone with a much better grasp of academic history than me to teach such a course, so it will be an idea hovering around without ever quite being the focus."

    "text": "John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was the most important economist of his generation, and arguably of any generation. But before he was an economist, he was a philosopher, and philosophical themes recur throughout his writings. This seminar is going to look at his early philosophical work, and some of the philosophical themes in his later economic and political work.\nKeynes (or Maynard as he was primarily known) was the son of John Neville Keynes (1852-1949) and Florence Ada Keynes (1861-1958). His mother was a remarkable figure, who in the 1930s became Mayor of Cambridge, and who was probably very important to Keynes’s education and character development. But his father is a little more interesting to our story.\nNeville Keynes, like Maynard, was both an economist and a philosopher. As we’ll see through the course, this was not at all an uncommon combination during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially in England. Neville worked at Cambridge for most of his career, moving between academic and administrative roles. He published two notable books, a logic book in 1884, and an economics book in 1891. The logic book was the last great text of pre-Fregean logic, and gets cited throughout the 20th (and occasionally the 21st) centuries, especially by philosophers keen to present a more nuanced view of pre-Fregean logic than the caricatured version presented in standard histories.\nSo Maynard grew up around Cambridge. At the time, the field his father worked in was called Moral Sciences, and it covered what we’d now call economics, psychology, and philosophy, with philosophy being the largest part. And while his father was not exactly an academic star - he spent as much time working in university administration as working as a researcher, and his last major work came decades before his retirement - Maynard certainly grew up comfortable in academic settings.\nMaynard’s intense home education paid off when he won a scholarship to Eton. He doesn’t seem to have developed a particularly close relationship to Eton. But Eton had a close connection to King’s College, Cambridge. (If you go to Cambridge, you’ll probably recognise it as the College with the fanciest chapel.) And as a graduate of Eton, Maynard won a place at King’s, and stayed connected to King’s for the rest of his life. His undergraduate degree was in mathematics. At the time Cambridge did a rank ordering of the mathematics graduates, the best being First Wrangler, the next Second Wrangler, and so on. Maynard finished 12th, which upset his parents, but seemed to satisfy him.\nAfter finishing his mathematics degree, he spent two more years around Cambridge. Officially he was preparing to take the civil service examination. Unofficially, he was kind of hanging around. But these years are particularly important to our story for two reasons. First, he spent a lot of this time sitting in on philosophy classes, and talking to philosophers, especially Moore and Russell. Second, he became a central figure in the Apostles.\nThe Apostles is (I believe to this day) a somewhat secretive discussion group primarily for undergraduates at Cambridge, consisting entirely of people who have been invited to join. They met (meet?) weekly to discuss some topic or other, usually something that at least had the pretence of being academic. At the time Maynard arrived, the club had two distinguishing characteristics. One was that it was heavily connected to philosophy. Sidgwick had been a lifelong active member, and Russell and Moore were heavily involved. (Wittgenstein had a complicated relationship to it, like he did to most things.) The other was that a very large proportion of the membership were gay. This apparently amused Russell, but Moore remained (if the stories can be believed) completely oblivious to the fact. Anyway, the friends Keynes made through the Apostles became many of his closest friends for life. And the mid-1900s Apostles became the core of the Bloomsbury group, the interwar group of writers, artists, and intellectuals who lived near the British Museum (i.e., in Bloomsbury). This group included (depending on whose definitions you read), Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster, Roger Fry, Duncan Grant, and several other notables. And they basically were Keynes’s main social and intellectual contacts until the 1930s.\nKeynes took the civil service examination in 1906 and was disappointed to only come second. He’d been hoping to come first and get his choice of positions, which would have meant going to Treasury. Instead he came second, and had to settle for a position in the India Office. He never travelled to India, but did read and learn enough about it to eventually write a book, his first published book, on Indian Currency and Finance. I’ve never read it, and I’m not sure if there is anything of interest to us in it.\nHe didn’t stay in the India office for long, returning to Cambridge in 1908. He was employed as a lecturer in economics, close to what we’d now call an adjunct, though his classes were very popular. (Note that at this stage he’s taken no classes in economics, and is largely self-taught.) He was also working on something close to what we’d call a philosophy PhD, with the results being an early draft of the Treatise on Probability. This was very widely discussed at Cambridge, and went through extensive revisions over the drafts. Somehow (and I really don’t understand how), he was appointed as editor of The Economic Journal in 1911, a position he held until near the end of his life. After publishing the Indian finance book in 1913 he was appointed to a Royal Commission on the Indian economy, which increased his fame in official London circles.\nIn 1914 he was back in Cambridge working again on the probability book. The legend (repeated in a lot of places, but I’m not sure if I believe it) is that when war broke out, Keynes was talking with Russell (about probability) on the main street of Cambridge when a motorcycle with a sidecar attached pulled up. It had been sent from London by Treasury officials desperate to get Keynes to London to help with wartime financing as urgently as possible. He jumped in the sidecar, and was a Treasury official for the next five years.\nWe don’t need to spend much time on what he did at Treasury during the war, because while it is interesting to historians of public finance, it doesn’t have a great deal of philosophical import. (At least on my understanding of the philosophy/non-philosophy boundary.) The main thing to know is that by the end of the war, Keynes was one of the most respected technocrats in London. So naturally he was part of the Treasury delegation to the Paris Peace Conference after the war, the conference that led to the Treaty of Versailles.\nKeynes was not part of the delegation by the time the treaty was signed. He had resigned in protest at the harshness of the terms being imposed on Germany, and returned home to write a book setting out his objections. The book, published in November 1919, was called The Economic Consequences of the Peace, and is a devastating attack on the treaty and on the people who put it together.\nI haven’t set any of the Versailles book in the reading for this class, because ultimately I couldn’t find a part that seemed suitable for a weekly seminar. I do think it should be treated as a work in political philosophy; very applied political philosophy to be sure, but still philosophy. It’s hard to read the first few pages and not see a vivid moral theory that’s illuminating the whole work. But that theory is stated more than defended, and the practical issues are not exactly our practical issues. Still, I very much recommend reading it, especially the first few chapters, before you get to all the tables about the details of this or that part of the reparations. It’s an astounding piece of writing, one that amazed Keynes’s literary friends, who had no idea that he was in their league as a writer.\nIn one of the most quoted passages of the book, Keynes describes what life was life was like for the upper-middle classes of England before the war. We could definitely question how realistic Keynes was being when he said this state of affairs was attainable for many people, or how good a state of affairs it was. But I think it’s really interesting, and so evocative of a certain way of life. (Note the absence of passports as one aspect of the world Keynes so desperately wants to bring back.)\n\nWhat an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end in August, 1914! The greater part of the population, it is true, worked hard and lived at a low standard of comfort, yet were, to all appearances, reasonably contented with this lot. But escape was possible, for any man of capacity or character at all exceeding the average, into the middle and upper classes, for whom life offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences, comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most powerful monarchs of other ages. The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend. He could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality, could despatch his servant to the neighbouring office of a bank for such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs, bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference. But, most important of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable. The projects and politics of militarism and imperialism, of racial and cultural rivalries, of monopolies, restrictions, and exclusion, which were to play the serpent to this paradise, were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper, and appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life, the internationalisation of which was nearly complete in practice.\n\nThe book has two central claims. One is that the demands of the treaty will be literally impossible to meet, unless perhaps they are met by literally starving the German people. The other is that this will all lead to another war. And while there definitely was another war, both claims have been controversial. It’s been argued that Keynes underestimated the German economy. The most ironic version of this argument is that the economic theory of this book is too indebted to the flawed economic theories from the turn of the century; if one analysed the situation using a correct theory, like that in Keynes’s General Theory, Germany’s situation would not look as dire. It’s also been argued that the book was a self-fulfilling prophecy. What led to the next war was not the Versailles Treaty, but the impression that the Treaty was unfair. And that impression was as much due to Keynes’s book as to the Treaty itself.\nThat last claim might seem absurd until you realise how big a deal the book was. It sold 100,000 copies, was translated into 12 languages, and its view of the peace treaty, especially the phrase that it was a Carthaginian Peace, became commonplace throughout the world. It contributed, somewhat unintentionally, to America’s refusal to join the League of Nations. And while it led to Keynes becoming famous throughout the world, it meant that he was well and truly out of favour in official London.\nThat last point is relevant to our story because the next few years would be amongst the most prolific in Keynes’s already prolific writing career. In quick succession he published three books. In 1921 he finally published the long gestating Treatise on Probability. In 1922 he published a sequel to the Versailles book, A Revision of the Treaty, which had a much smaller impact than its prequel. And in 1923 he published A Tract on Monetary Reform. The Tract grew out of some columns he wrote for the Guardian, who sent him to a conference on post-war reconstruction as a columnist. On the one hand, being a columnist for a national newspaper means one is still somewhat part of the national conversation. Still, it’s a long way from the official standing Keynes had had before the publication of his Versailles book.\nThe Tract, and some of the writings around that time, are interesting in part because they address a question that has recently taken on some practical significance. Assume we think, as Keynes will later come to deny, that something like price stability is an important object of government policy. And assume also that prices have recently risen sharply. What should the government now aim at? One option is to try to stabilise prices at this new higher level. Another is to return prices to where they were, i.e., to have a bout of deflation to ensure that long-term prices are stable. As far as I know, the latter view has no serious proponents nowadays. But it was taken seriously when Keynes was writing. Indeed, it seems to have been behind some of the disastrous decisions Churchill made as Chancellor of the Exchequer (the UK equivalent of Treasury Secretary) during the 1920s. Keynes, though not yet as relaxed about inflation as he would be in his later career, thought this was a terrible idea, and that whatever evils inflation might have, deflation was so much worse that we’d have to just live with this new higher price level. On this point, conventional wisdom now entirely agrees with Keynes. Milton Friedman later said that he liked this book very much. If you don’t know Friedman’s work, it’s probably too much of a digression to go into why this might be a bit surprising, but it is indicative both of how much more centrist Keynes was in the 1920s than the 1930s, and how much political debates have shifted over the last 100 years.\nThe early 1920s also saw a major change to Keynes’s personal life: he got married. This was particularly surprising since as far as we can tell, he had had exclusively male romantic partners up until then. But he fell in love with a Russian ballerina, Lydia Lopokova. This led to something of a falling out with Keynes’s Bloomsbury friends, some of whom didn’t take Lydia seriously, and preferred not to have her around intellectual conversations. But Keynes was devoted to her and, again as best we can tell, was entirely faithful during their marriage (if not during their courtship). He was a dedicated supporter of the arts, and this included building a theatre in Cambridge, in part for Lydia to have somewhere to perform. They didn’t have any children.\nThe rest of the 1920s was Keynes’s most prolific period for public writing. This was helped in part by his leading a consortium that bought The Nation and Athaneum in 1923, which meant he had easy access to its pages. He was encouraged to hire T. S. Eliot as literary editor, but the two of them didn’t get along, so the job went to Leonard Woolf. The financial stability of this job helped the Woolfs get the Hogarth Press running, which soon published Virginia Woolf’s most famous works. One other amusing aside about this time. During the 1926 General Strike, Keynes and Woolf disagreed about what the magazine should do. Keynes wanted to run articles supporting the strikers; Woolf wanted to go on strike in solidarity with them. Keynes was officially the boss, but Woolf had possession of the printing press; there was no strike edition.\nThere are two really notable pieces to comes out of this flurry of public writing. In 1929, as part of the Liberal election campaign, he and Hubert Henderson (an important economist and another of his employees at The Nation) wrote Can Lloyd George Do It?. This was a defence of David Lloyd George’s New Deal-like economic plans that he was taking to the 1929 election. Given the harshness of Keynes’s tone towards Lloyd George a decade earlier, it was remarkable that the two could become close collaborators. But it made little difference; the Liberals did poorly at the 1929 election, and the result was the first ever Labour government. The other, which we’ll talk about more next week, was his essay Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren. This was one of the last things he published in The Nation before selling/shutting it, as in 1931 it merged with the moderate Labour publication The New Statesman, and Keynes retained some influence with the new journal. (And published some interesting work in it, though not enough to stop the magazine’s lurch to the Stalinist left.)\nIn 1930 Keynes also published what was intended at the time to be his magnum opus, the two volume Treatise on Money. This is a difficult book for several reasons. It’s not that difficult on a page-by-page basis, though some of the terminology takes some getting used to. Indeed some of the passages contain some of Keynes’s best academic writing. It’s rather that seeing how the whole fits together can be a challenge. Keynes himself is said to have thought the work an “artistic failure”, and attributed its difficult structure to the fact that he changed his mind too often while writing it.\nAfter this, Keynes set to work on his real magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. As the Great Depression hit, he was still writing in public to encourage greater public works programs. He was strongly in favour of the New Deal as a whole, though he disapproved of some parts. His loud support for it led to a meeting with President Roosevelt, though probably not much came of it. But it did mean that he was thinking more and more about America, and in some ways The General Theory is more about America than about Britain. It’s notable, for example, that it contains relatively little discussion of foreign trade, or even of currency movements. In economists’ terms, it’s more like a discussion of a closed economy than an open one. Keynes spent more time in Cambridge over these years, developing a tight circle of admirers and collaborators. These included Richard Kahn, the developer of the concept of the multiplier, and Joan Robinson, among other things the great theorist of imperfect competition. These younger economists played important roles in developing the General Theory. So did Keynes’s sometimes acrimonious letters with economists of his generation who opposed his views. (Many of these letters have been published, and they are a helpful resource in understanding The General Theory and its development.)\nThe General Theory came out in February 1936 and it was, by academic standards, a publishing sensation. Keynes had insisted it come out in paperback, and affordably priced, and sold well. Among academics, it became the most important work in economics for generations. Google Scholar today has it at 58000 citations (though these are wrongly attributed to a 1937 article that we’ll get to later). The book develops a model of the economy where decisions whether to invest are the driving force behind the level of employment we see, as opposed to models that prioritise either the wages demanded by workers (as in simple supply-demand models of employment), and to models where decisions to save were the driving force (as Keynes himself had to an extent believed when he was younger). The short term political upshot of this model was that deficit-financed spending, especially on infrastructure, was a good way to get out of slumps like we saw in the 1930s. As with Keynes’s earlier arguments against trying to undo inflations, this has again acquired the status of something like conventional wisdom. The longer term political upshots of the model were, well that’s a more contentious issue. Keynes himself says at the end of the book:\n\nI conceive, therefore, that a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment will prove the only means of securing an approximation to full employment; though this need not exclude all manner of compromises and of devices by which public authority will co-operate with private initiative.\n\nAnd this is in a paragraph that starts “In some other respects the foregoing theory is moderately conservative in its implications”! I don’t think we’ll really get into it in this course, but exactly what the ideal state would be for Keynes, and how it relates to other grand ideal political theories, especially other ones that call for “comprehensive socialisation of investment”, is an interesting question.\nKeynes wrote a number of journal articles immediately after the publication of the General Theory responding to critics and spelling out the theory some more. The most notable of these for our purposes is the confusingly named 1937 article in the Quarterly Journal of Economics called “The General Theory of Employment”. (This is the article Google Scholar assigns all the citations to.) Among other things, this article spells out in a bit more detail some of the connections between the Treatise on Probability and the General Theory, though exactly how to interpret this connection, and this article, is a matter of some scholarly dispute. (I tried to join this dispute as a grad student, but I didn’t have luck getting early things published, and soon gave up. But I still have strong views about some of the participants in it.)\nThen, in late 1937, Keynes had a massive heart attack. It didn’t kill him, but it did knock him out of serious work for nearly two years. By the time he was relatively recovered (he never really fully recovered), the world had changed completely. World War II had started, and all the challenges of wartime meant that the challenges of how to handle a slump stopped being the centre of attention. Keynes died in 1946 without ever really returning to his more theoretical work, so we don’t have as much as we’d like of follow-ups to the General Theory as we’d like.\nWith a war on, official Britain again turned to Keynes to figure out what to do with its finances. In 1940 he published an interesting pamphlet called How to Pay for the War, which dealt with how Keynes thought wartime inflation and shortages should be managed. The same year he and Pierro Sraffa (another economist we could do a seminar about) wrote a paper arguing that David Hume was the author of the “Abstract” of the Treatise on Human Nature. I gather they were largely convincing, and this is now usually attributed to Hume. He worked with his friend William Beveridge on a report into post-war welfare systems. This report, which became popularly known as The Beveridge Report, was very influential on the post-war Labour government, which established the comprehensive welfare state. And then Keynes set seriously to work on the negotiations with the Allies on what post-war international finance will look like. This gets both well outside my expertise, and well outside what most people would consider philosophy work, and we’re not going to cover it at all in this course. Suffice to note that Keynes spent the latter half of the war shuttling back and forth between the US and UK - not a minor exercise with U-Boats everywhere. And he was at the centre of all the negotiations that established the post-war financial institutions, including the Bretton Woods system of managed currencies, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. But that didn’t mean he designed these things; in fact he was on the losing side of many of the debates and negotiations. America, not Britain, was going to call the shots after the war, and there was little that a British diplomat could do about it, even if they were the greatest economist of the age.\nKeynes had never been in the best of health. He didn’t exercise much, he smoked heavily, and medical care wasn’t as good then as it is now. At times during the war, and especially during his travel around the US from one negotiation to another, he came perilously close to death. So it wasn’t a surprise that he died soon after the war, in 1946. He was survived by his wife, who lived until the late 1970s, and both managed and guarded Keynes’s intellectual legacy.\nI’ve listed these in the narrative, but it’s worthwhile having a list of Keynes’s books in one place:\n\nIndian Currency and Finance (1913)\nThe Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919)\nTreatise on Probability (1921)\nA Revision of the Treaty (1922)\nA Tract on Monetary Reform (1923)\nTreatise on Money 2 vols (1930)\nThe General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936)\n\nFor modern academics, you’d also expect a list of the important journal articles. But despite being the editor of The Economic Journal for more than three decades, Keynes didn’t have that many famous journal articles. The 1937 article we’ll look at is probably the most famous. What he did have were public writings, letters, official reports, speeches, and obituaries. Two ‘greatest hits’ volumes of these writings were collected in his lifetime, Essays in Persuasion and Essays in Biography. Just to confuse everyone, these have been frequently reissued with extra pieces added to them, though I think we’ve just about standardised on the versions in the (Cambridge University Press issued) Collected Works.\nIn 1949 his estate issued a small book, Two Memoirs, containing two pieces that he’d held for posthumous publication. One of these, My Early Beliefs, we will discuss in detail next week. It goes into great detail about Keynes’s philosophical education;the early beliefs were largely the result of reading and talking about Moore’s Principia Ethica. But it was written in 1938, while Keynes was recovering from the heart attack, and 35 years after some of the events described, and some have questioned its accuracy. I think it’s delightful, and fascinating, and I’ll have much more to say about it going forward. The other paper Melchior, a Defeated Enemy, is a quite remarkable memoir of his time at the Peace Conference. It contains a confession to a bit of light treason (not quite stated as such), and possibly to other crimes, some sweeping generalisations about other nationalities and regions, and some of the best writing I’ve ever seen from an academic. It should come with all the content warnings, and did even in 1949, but you should also read it."

    "title": "The Moral Sciences Tripos",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the late 19th century, if you were a Cambridge student interested in philosophy very broadly construed, the degree you took was called Moral Sciences. It was officially called the Moral Sciences Tripos, but exactly what a Tripos is, and why it was called that, don’t matter that much to our story. What matters is that it was a three year degree, and it was centred around examinations at the end of the second and third year.\nNote that this is in England, so it’s the English university system. And that’s a bit different to what you might be used to in America, Australia, Canada, Scotland, or elsewhere in the English speaking world. In England, in Keynes’s time as now, undergraduates take all their courses in the subject they are taking their degree in. I think this is part of the appeal of degrees like PPE in England; it means that students aren’t quite so concentrated. But it also means that just the sheer number of courses means that most students take a lot of courses in almost every sub-discipline of their degree. Relatedly, students in Moral Sciences were expected to complete a common exam, which covered the whole of the discipline.\nAnd what was the discipline of moral sciences? The best guide I’ve found is an 1891 [student’s guide to the University of Cambridge], which includes a lot of advice for students taking Moral Sciences. That’s a little hard to read, but thankfully Irwin Collier, who has a fantastic site on archival artifacts from the history of economics has made an HTML version of the Moral Sciences part. He notes that Keynes, i.e., John Neville Keynes, contributed to the part of the guide on political economy. The guide describes in some detail what students should know for the two big exams, with this being the important overview.\n\nThe examination for the Moral Sciences Tripos consists of two parts; and begins, as a rule, upon the Monday after the last Sunday but one in May. No student may present himself for both parts in the same year. The first part consists of two papers on each of the following subjects: Psychology including Ethical Psychology; Logic and Methodology; Political Economy; together with a paper of Essays. …\nThe subjects of the second part of the examination fall into two groups:–(A) Metaphysics, Political Philosophy, Ethics–on each of which there is one paper–and (B) the following special subjects, History of Philosophy, Advanced Logic and Methodology, Advanced Psychology and Psychophysics, Advanced Political Economy. There are two papers on each of these special subjects besides an Essay paper containing questions on all the above subjects. Every student must take one, and may not take more than two, of the special subjects; also every student must take the papers on Metaphysics and Ethics except those who select Advanced Political Economy as a special subject: for such students the paper on Political Philosophy is provided as an alternative for Metaphysics.\n\nSo that’s what you had to do: psychology (including what we’d now call moral psychology), logic, politics/economics, and then in senior year, metaphysics (though you can opt out of that), political philosophy, ethics, history of philosophy, and advanced versions of the earlier material. Metaphysics, by the way, means largely what we’d call epistemology. The first topic is “Knowledge, its analysis and general characteristics: material and formal elements of knowledge; self-consciousness as unifying principle; uniformity and continuity of experience.”, and there are several more about certainty, coordination (social epistemology!), and others. Again, you can follow the links to see the details in what the parts that would now be considered philosophy consist in.\nThe economics and psychology parts are shot through with names that we’d consider philosophers. The economics section lists (John Stuart) Mill, Sidgwick, Jevons, (John Neville) Keynes, and, of course, Smith. The psychology section has Dewey and James as the most important figures. If you think about contemporary philosophy departments, this shouldn’t be a surprise. It’s natural that people in philosophy, as it is construed at a time, will know a lot about philosophy, as it is construed at that time. And at the time, philosophy included pretty much all of what we’d now call Cognitive Science, and pretty much all of what we’d now call PPE. (Michigan Philosophy is, in this respect, trying to return philosophy to its former glory.)\nBut a lot changed in 1903. It was a big year for Cambridge Moral Sciences. Moore published Principia Ethica, a book we’ll talk a lot about in this course. Russell published The Principles of Mathematics, which we won’t talk about at all after this sentence. And a campaign led by Alfred Marshall, but opposed by many others, finally succeeded in breaking off Economics from Moral Sciences, and creating its own tripos (i.e., degree).\nThis didn’t affect Maynard Keynes directly; he was a mathematics undergraduate. But it had a massive effect on his overall life. For one thing, it complicated his father’s position; when the split happened he naturally went into Economics, but it probably led to him doing less philosophical work than he otherwise might have. (Remember he had written the most important logic book of the years immediately preceding Frege and Russell.) But it also led to complications for Maynard’s position. He had obvious leanings towards economics, not least because he wanted to work in Treasury. But he also wanted to work on, for related reasons, Moorean ethics, and the foundations of probability. All of this would have been easier in the old Moral Sciences program than it was in the world that was created by the split. We shouldn’t overstate this - interaction between departments at Cambridge has always been very strong compared to other places, and it certainly didn’t stop Keynes talking with Russell about probability, or Edgeworth publishing on probability in Mind. And Keynes spent a lot of time (really, a lot of time) with Wittgenstein, so it wasn’t like he was out of the loop in philosophy. Still, I can’t help wonder what his career would have looked like had it been spent entirely in a department centred around philosophy.\nI’m going over this all at some length in part because it is so important to Keynes’s intellectual background, but in part because it seems more important to the history of analytic philosophy than is usually accounted for. I don’t know how much it comes up these days, but until circa 2010, the standard introductory course in a US analytic philosophy program (the pro-sem) was typically a course on the foundations of analytic philosophy, with a special focus on Frege, Russell, and (early) Wittgenstein. You saw variations on this theme, maybe some Moore here, some late Wittgenstein there, often some Kripke to make it more contemporary, but that was the basic idea. And so much of that story is taking place at Cambridge, in this middle of which the department these folks are in goes through this big split.\nOne thing you might notice from that list of names is that, with the partial exception of Moore, there isn’t much ethics there, and no political philosophy. (And it’s Moore’s meta-ethics, or his metaphysics and epistemology, that were covered in these courses, not his normative ethics. Of course Russell had a lot to say about politics, and political philosophy, but that’s not read much in contemporary philosophy.) Given how central Sidgwick was to the previous generation of Cambridge philosophers, that’s something of a surprise. I really don’t have the evidence for this, but it’s a speculation. One thing that I’ve seen after the few department splits I know about (Sydney in the 1960s, Irvine more recently) is that subjects that are sort of between the specialisations of the new department get a little left out. It’s more common to see neither department do them than to see both. I wonder how much losing political economy meant that the remaining philosophers thought that political philosophy wasn’t part of their jurisdiction any more, and/or that the people who might have been the Cambridge moral and political philosophers of the early 20th century simply moved departments in the split. As I said, I don’t really know if this is even a viable theory, but I think the split is an important and under-discussed part of a really significant moment in the history of philosophy."

    "text": "We’re going to be talking a lot about Keynes’s intellectual achievements and virtues in this course, so it’s worth being up front about some of his more prominent shortcomings. How much these shortcomings matter to his work is, I think, an interesting and non-obvious question.\n\nEugenics\nKeynes was a committed eugenicist. I don’t mean that he positively favored killing off disabled infants, or any of the other worst features of eugenics. But he definitely believed in a lot of eugenic theories. He thought that the most important intellectual figures in English history came from a handful of extended families. His biographical essays often include long discussions of the lineage of the subject, explaining their intellectual successes as a consequence of their ancestry. And he adored Galton, who seemed at time to rival only Einstein as his contemporary intellectual heroes.\n\n\nRacism\nKeynes’s world consisted largely of Western Europe and North America. He wrote a book about India, but never went there. He was aware of how racist the US was, especially in the south, and it made him personally uncomfortable when he was directly confronted with it on his travels. But he didn’t actually do anything about this discomfort, even though his contacts with FDR meant that he could possibly have done something. The urge to protest that was so vivid on other fields seems to have gone missing here. I suspect they are there somewhere, but I haven’t found any particular racist comments about Blacks, either from Africa or the Americas, in Keynes’s writings. What we get instead is that Blacks are almost invisible to him. They aren’t his concern. I don’t really know what a contemporary parallel to this is. I don’t mean this to be exculpatory; it’s obviously not great to just not care about a huge percentage of humanity. But it’s not the kind of racism you might expect.\n\n\nAnti-Semitism\nOn the other hand, he did make some terribly anti-semitic remarks. You see some of them already in “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren”, and there are worse remarks included in one of the pieces on Einstein in Essays in Biography.\nThis was obviously not just a case of indifference. Keynes interacted with many Jewish people. Here are just four prominent examples, though we could pick more. He employed Leonard Woolf for a while, effectively subsidising Virginia’s writing. He did a lot of work to deal with Wittgenstein’s many foibles. (I can’t prove this, but I really think he thought of his relationship with Wittgenstein as an echo of Hume’s relationship with Rousseau.) His closest collaborator in the 1930s was Richard Kahn, probably the one person Keynes most identified as being his student. (Kahn developed the concept of the multiplier, which became so central to practical applications of Keynes’s work.) And the name of his most important book was chosen as a deliberate homage to Einstein’s work.\nAnd despite all these personal interactions, he still managed to harbor some awful general attitudes about Jews as a group. I honestly don’t know how much this affected his personal interactions with individual people. There is some evidence that it damaged his relationship with Leonard Woolf, but it’s sketchy. It’s mostly just depressing that someone smart enough to know better, and with so much relevant evidence from personal acquaintances, could still fall into believing lazy stereotypes.\nKeynes had a lot more stereotypical beliefs (in both senses) about people from various European countries, with the stereotypes he had about French, German, and Welsh people being possibly the most notable in the ways they affected his work. On the whole these didn’t seem as pernicious to me, and instead point to interesting questions about where we draw the line between lazy stereotyping, and carefully observing general characteristics. There is something like a trigger warning before some of the papers in later versions of Essays in Biography on these points, though it seems unnecessary to me. In any case, I haven’t found anything in his generalisations about other European countries that’s nearly as appalling as the anti-semitic views he occasionally let slip out."

    "text": "I’m writing a bunch of background notes for the students in the seminar. These are basically things that got cut from the notes for week 1, which were getting out of control. I think everything I say here is true, though I suspect it will seem more than a bit shallow to people who are actually experts in the field. But they seemed like useful things for students to know when reading about this time. The first is on the party system that predominated for most of Keynes’s life in the UK, which featured three main parties.\nTo understand some of the political debates that Keynes is involved with, it helps to have a sense of the political parties at the time. Great Britain had, for most of Keynes’s life, something like a three party system. I say “Great Britain” here because (a) the same parties were strong in England, Scotland and Wales, but quite different parties were strong in Ireland. But Keynes had next to nothing to say on Irish matters, and I’ll ignore the Irish parties from now on.\nFrom right to left, the three parties were the Conservative, or Tory, Party, the Liberal Party, and the Labour Party. You can get a bit of a sense of their strengths over time from this graph of the number of seats in the House of Commons they had after each election from 1895-1979. (though we’ll come back to why this is potentially misleading in a bit).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this was much more of a two-party system when Keynes was younger. I haven’t included them here, but the main Irish party had more members of the House of Commons than Labour for most of the time until Irish independence after WWI. Still, Labour was there, and after WWI became more and more important.\nKeynes was by inclination, upbringing, and social class, a Liberal. Indeed he was one of the more prominent Liberal public intellectuals for much of his life. For many of his political projects, convincing his fellow Liberals that he was right was a key part of his strategy. (Though he also often worked by trying to convince technocrats.) I believe he voted Liberal at every election in his life except 1945, when like practically everyone else he voted Labour.\nI’ve said that the parties could be arranged right-to-left, and that’s roughly right, but only roughly. The Conservatives were in some ways more religiously tolerant than the Liberals. They were much less anti-Catholic, going back to the two parties views on the Glorious Revolution. And they had a Jewish leader, Disraeli, which it is hard to imagine the Liberals having done. More importantly for our story, one of the big divisions between the parties was on trade. The Liberals were, almost as a matter of identity, pro-free trade, while the Conservatives were more protectionist. I don’t know how free-trade versus protectionism gets coded as left/right these days, but certainly at some times it has been coded as free-trade being the right-wing view here. When Keynes suggested that tariffs might be part of the best response to the Great Depression, this was as large a break from Liberal orthodoxy as he made any time in his life.\nNow there is one important sense in which everything I’ve said here was a bit misleading. From 1916 to 1926, the Liberal party was split into two factions, one organised around Asquith (the PM until 1916), and the other around Lloyd George (the PM after 1916). The two factions, although still in some sense part of the same party, contested elections against each other. Keynes was originally on Asquith’s side (because he agreed with Asquith about how to conduct the war, and then importantly about Versailles) but eventually switched to Lloyd George’s side (because of how hostile Asquith was to the general strike).\nIt’s also worth noting how much tighter the connection between academia and politics was in those days. Asquith, who was PM from 1908-1916, had a post-doc at Oxford. And Arthur Balfour, one of the most important Conservatives of the first two decades of the 20th Century, and for a short time PM himself, was a philosopher. He wrote several articles in Mind, as well as a book critically surveying the popular philosophical views of the late 19th century. His criticisms of idealism anticipate in some respects Moore’s more famous criticisms. And Balfour’s connections to philosophy proved very helpful to philosophers who got themselves into high profile scraps. He couldn’t keep Russell out of prison during WWI, but he did intervene to make sure Russell got particularly lenient treatment.\nKeynes seems to have had a real visceral dislike for most Conservatives. See for instance this rather pointed passage from his obituary for Asquith.\n\nHis temperament was naturally conservative. With a little stupidity and a few prejudices dashed in he would have been Conservative in the political sense also.\n\nBut Keynes’s obituary for Balfour, while somewhat impersonal, is very generous in its intellectual praise, favourably comparing Balfour’s early economic work in the 1890s to that of the more famous economists of the time."

    "text": "By David Garnett1\nThe paper which follows was written as the result of a memoir of mine which was read in Lord Keynes’s absence, owing, I think, to his illness. It was afterwards sent to him to read. I am not sure of the date when my paper was read, but the envelope in which it is contained shows that it was returned by him from Tilton at the end of August 1938. His paper, which is printed here, was written at the beginning of September, when my paper was fresh in his mind. The subject of my memoir was the story of my introducing several of my friends to D. H. Lawrence, his intense dislike of them, and my bitter disappointment, which led me to stop seeing Lawrence. Keynes was one of my friends whom Lawrence most disliked. His feeling about them was, in essence, religious intolerance. He was a prophet who hated all those whose creeds protected them from ever becoming his disciples. I brought this out in my memoir and thus led Keynes to the re­ examination of his early beliefs which follows.\nI had got to know Lawrence and Frieda in 1912 owing to my father’s friendship with him.\nI was extremely fond of him and have no doubt that he liked me. I have never met a writer who appeared to have such genius. I greatly admired, and still admire, his short stories, his poems and several of his novels, particularly his first novel The White Peacock. But I was a rationalist and a scientist, and I was repelled by his intuitive and dogmatic philosophy, whereas the ideas of my friends from Cambridge interested and attracted me.\nIt was thus inevitable that sooner or later Lawrence should spew me out of his mouth, since I could never take his philo­sophy seriously. The breach was merely hastened by his meeting my friends. After my last visit to stay with Lawrence he wrote to Lady Ottoline Morrell, to whom I had also introduced him, in a letter included in his published correspondence:\n\nWe had David Garnett and Francis Birrell here for the week-end. When Bir­rell comes, tired and a bit lost and wandering-I love him. But, my God, to hear him talk sends me mad. To hear these young people talk really fills me with black fury: they talk endlessly, but endlessly-and never, never a good thing said. They are cased each in a hard little shell of his own and out of this they talk words. There is never for one second any outgoing of feeling and no reverence, not a crumb or grain of reverence. I cannot stand it. I will not have people like this-I had rather be alone. They made me dream of a beetle that bites like a scorpion. But I killed it-a very large beetle. I scotched it and it ran off-but I came on it again, and killed it. It is this horror of little swarming selves I can’t stand.\n\nOn the same day, the 19 April 1915, Lawrence wrote to me:\n\nMy dear David,\nNever bring Birrell to see me any more. There is something nasty about him like black beetles. He is horrible and unclean. I feel I should go mad when I think of your set, Duncan Grant and Keynes and Birrell. It makes me dream of beetles. In Cambridge I had a similar dream. I had felt it slightly before in the Stracheys. But it came full upon me in Keynes and in Duncan Grant. And yesterday I knew it again in Birrell ... you must leave these friends, these beetles, Birrell and Duncan Grant are done for forever. Keynes I am not sure ... when I saw Keynes that morning in Cambridge it was one of the crises of my life. It sent me mad with misery and hostility and rage ...\n\nI replied to this letter, which was really an ultimatum telling me to break with him or with my friends, as I thought suitably and I only once saw Lawrence again, by accident, on Armistice Night, the 11 November 1918, in Montague Shearman’s rooms in the Adelphi. The breach would no doubt have been healed had Lawrence been more often in England. I continued to see Frieda when she visited England periodically, and in 1928 I wrote to Lawrence to tell him how much I admired Lady Chatterley’s Lover in a letter which pleased him, and he wrote me a warm and friendly letter in return.\nThe reader is now in possession of the facts which led Maynard Keynes to re-examine his beliefs and those of his closest friends when they were undergraduates at Cambridge."

    "text": "I\nWe are suffering just now from a bad attack of economic pessimism. It is common to hear people say that the epoch of enormous economic progress which characterised the nineteenth century is over; that the rapid improvement in the standard of life is now going to slow down—at any rate in Great Britain; that a decline in prosperity is more likely than an improvement in the decade which lies ahead of us.\nI believe that this is a wildly mistaken interpretation of what is happening to us. We are suffering, not from the rheumatics of old age, but from the growing-pains of over-rapid changes, from the painfulness of readjustment between one economic period and another. The increase of technical efficiency has been taking place faster than we can deal with the problem of labour absorption; the improvement in the standard of life has been a little too quick; the banking and monetary system of the world has been preventing the rate of interest from falling as fast as equilibrium requires. And even so, the waste and confusion which ensue relate to not more than 7½ per cent of the national income; we are muddling away one and sixpence in the £, and have only 18s. 6d., when we might, if we were more sensible, have £1; yet, nevertheless, the 18s. 6d. mounts up to as much as the £1 would have been five or six years ago. We forget that in 1929 the physical output of the industry of Great Britain was greater than ever before, and that the net surplus of our foreign balance available for new foreign investment, after paying for all our imports, was greater last year than that of any other country, being indeed 50 per cent greater than the corresponding surplus of the United States. Or again—if it is to be a matter of comparisons—suppose that we were to reduce our wages by a half, repudiate four-fifths of the national debt, and hoard our surplus wealth in barren gold instead of lending it at 6 per cent or more, we should resemble the now much-envied France. But would it be an improvement?\nThe prevailing world depression, the enormous anomaly of unemployment in a world full of wants, the disastrous mistakes we have made, blind us to what is going on under the surface—to the true interpretation of the trend of things. For I predict that both of the two opposed errors of pessimism which now make so much noise in the world will be proved wrong in our own time—the pessimism of the revolutionaries who think that things are so bad that nothing can save us but violent change, and the pessimism of the reactionaries who consider the balance of our economic and social life so precarious that we must risk no experiments.\nMy purpose in this essay, however, is not to examine the present or the near future, but to disembarrass myself of short views and take wings into the future. What can we reasonably expect the level of our economic life to be a hundred years hence? What are the economic possibilities for our grandchildren?\nFrom the earliest times of which we have record—back, say, to two thousand years before Christ—down to the beginning of the eighteenth century, there was no very great change in the standard of life of the average man living in the civilised centres of the earth. Ups and downs certainly. Visitations of plague, famine, and war. Golden intervals. But no progressive, violent change. Some periods perhaps 50 per cent better than others—at the utmost 100 per cent better—in the four thousand years which ended (say) in A.D. 1700.\nThis slow rate of progress, or lack of progress, was due to two reasons—to the remarkable absence of important technical improvements and to the failure of capital to accumulate.\nThe absence of important technical inventions between the prehistoric age and comparatively modern times is truly remarkable. Almost everything which really matters and which the world possessed at the commencement of the modern age was already known to man at the dawn of history. Language, fire, the same domestic animals which we have to-day, wheat, barley, the vine and the olive, the plough, the wheel, the oar, the sail, leather, linen and cloth, bricks and pots, gold and silver, copper, tin, and lead—and iron was added to the list before 1000 B.C.—banking, statecraft, mathematics, astronomy, and religion. There is no record of when we first possessed these things.\nAt some epoch before the dawn of history—perhaps even in one of the comfortable intervals before the last ice age—there must have been an era of progress and invention comparable to that in which we live to-day. But through the greater part of recorded history there was nothing of the kind.\nThe modern age opened, I think, with the accumulation of capital which began in the sixteenth century. I believe—for reasons with which I must not encumber the present argument—that this was initially due to the rise of prices, and the profits to which that led, which resulted from the treasure of gold and silver which Spain brought from the New World into the Old. From that time until to-day the power of accumulation by compound interest, which seems to have been sleeping for many generations, was re-born and renewed its strength. And the power of compound interest over two hundred years is such as to stagger the imagination.\nLet me give in illustration of this a sum which I have worked out. The value of Great Britain’s foreign investments to-day is estimated at about £4,000,000,000. This yields us an income at the rate of about 6½ per cent. Half of this we bring home and enjoy; the other half, namely, 3¼ per cent, we leave to accumulate abroad at compound interest. Something of this sort has now been going on for about 250 years.\nFor I trace the beginnings of British foreign investment to the treasure which Drake stole from Spain in 1580. In that year he returned to England bringing with him the prodigious spoils of the Golden Hind. Queen Elizabeth was a considerable shareholder in the syndicate which had financed the expedition. Out of her share she paid off the whole of England’s foreign debt, balanced her Budget, and found herself with about £40,000 in hand. This she invested in the Levant Company—which prospered. Out of the profits of the Levant Company, the East India Company was founded; and the profits of this great enterprise were the foundation of England’s subsequent foreign investment. Now it happens that £40,000 accumulating at 3¼ per cent compound interest approximately corresponds to the actual volume of England’s foreign investments at various dates, and would actually amount to-day to the total of £4,000,000,000 which I have already quoted as being what our foreign investments now are. Thus, every £1 which Drake brought home in 1580 has now become £100,000. Such is the power of compound interest!\nFrom the sixteenth century, with a cumulative crescendo after the eighteenth, the great age of science and technical inventions began, which since the beginning of the nineteenth century has been in full flood—coal, steam, electricity, petrol, steel, rubber, cotton, the chemical industries, automatic machinery and the methods of mass production, wireless, printing, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein, and thousands of other things and men too famous and familiar to catalogue.\nWhat is the result? In spite of an enormous growth in the population of the world, which it has been necessary to equip with houses and machines, the average standard of life in Europe and the United States has been raised, I think, about fourfold. The growth of capital has been on a scale which is far beyond a hundred-fold of what any previous age had known. And from now on we need not expect so great an increase of population.\nIf capital increases, say, 2 per cent per annum, the capital equipment of the world will have increased by a half in twenty years, and seven and a half times in a hundred years. Think of this in terms of material things—houses, transport, and the like.\nAt the same time technical improvements in manufacture and transport have been proceeding at a greater rate in the last ten years than ever before in history. In the United States factory output per head was 40 per cent greater in 1925 than in 1919. In Europe we are held back by temporary obstacles, but even so it is safe to say that technical efficiency is increasing by more than 1 per cent per annum compound. There is evidence that the revolutionary technical changes, which have so far chiefly affected industry, may soon be attacking agriculture. We may be on the eve of improvements in the efficiency of food production as great as those which have already taken place in mining, manufacture, and transport. In quite a few years—in our own lifetimes I mean—we may be able to perform all the operations of agriculture, mining, and manufacture with a quarter of the human effort to which we have been accustomed.\nFor the moment the very rapidity of these changes is hurting us and bringing difficult problems to solve. Those countries are suffering relatively which are not in the vanguard of progress. We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come—namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.\nBut this is only a temporary phase of maladjustment. All this means in the long run that mankind is solving its economic problem. I would predict that the standard of life in progressive countries one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as it is to-day. There would be nothing surprising in this even in the light of our present knowledge. It would not be foolish to contemplate the possibility of a far greater progress still.\n\n\nII\nLet us, for the sake of argument, suppose that a hundred years hence we are all of us, on the average, eight times better off in the economic sense than we are to-day. Assuredly there need be nothing here to surprise us.\nNow it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be insatiable. But they fall into two classes—those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not so true of the absolute needs—a point may soon be reached, much sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes.\nNow for my conclusion, which you will find, I think, to become more and more startling to the imagination the longer you think about it.\nI draw the conclusion that, assuming no important wars and no important increase in population, the economic problem may be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years. This means that the economic problem is not—if we look into the future—the permanent problem of the human race.\nWhy, you may ask, is this so startling? It is startling because—if, instead of looking into the future, we look into the past—we find that the economic problem, the struggle for subsistence, always has been hitherto the primary, most pressing problem of the human race—not only of the human race, but of the whole of the biological kingdom from the beginnings of life in its most primitive forms.\nThus we have been expressly evolved by nature—with all our impulses and deepest instincts—for the purpose of solving the economic problem. If the economic problem is solved, mankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose.\nWill this be a benefit? If one believes at all in the real values of life, the prospect at least opens up the possibility of benefit. Yet I think with dread of the readjustment of the habits and instincts of the ordinary man, bred into him for countless generations, which he may be asked to discard within a few decades.\nTo use the language of to-day—must we not expect a general “nervous breakdown”? We already have a little experience of what I mean—a nervous breakdown of the sort which is already common enough in England and the United States amongst the wives of the well-to-do classes, unfortunate women, many of them, who have been deprived by their wealth of their traditional tasks and occupations—who cannot find it sufficiently amusing, when deprived of the spur of economic necessity, to cook and clean and mend, yet are quite unable to find anything more amusing.\nTo those who sweat for their daily bread leisure is a longed-for sweet—until they get it.\nThere is the traditional epitaph written for herself by the old charwoman:—\n\nDon’t mourn for me, friends, don’t weep for me never,\nFor I’m going to do nothing for ever and ever.\n\nThis was her heaven. Like others who look forward to leisure, she conceived how nice it would be to spend her time listening-in—for there was another couplet which occurred in her poem:—\n\nWith psalms and sweet music the heavens’ll be ringing,\nBut I shall have nothing to do with the singing.\n\nYet it will only be for those who have to do with the singing that life will be tolerable—and how few of us can sing!\nThus for the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem—how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.\nThe strenuous purposeful money-makers may carry all of us along with them into the lap of economic abundance. But it will be those peoples, who can keep alive, and cultivate into a fuller perfection, the art of life itself and do not sell themselves for the means of life, who will be able to enjoy the abundance when it comes.\nYet there is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy. It is a fearful problem for the ordinary person, with no special talents, to occupy himself, especially if he no longer has roots in the soil or in custom or in the beloved conventions of a traditional society. To judge from the behaviour and the achievements of the wealthy classes to-day in any quarter of the world, the outlook is very depressing! For these are, so to speak, our advance guard—those who are spying out the promised land for the rest of us and pitching their camp there. For they have most of them failed disastrously, so it seems to me—those who have an independent income but no associations or duties or ties—to solve the problem which has been set them.\nI feel sure that with a little more experience we shall use the new-found bounty of nature quite differently from the way in which the rich use it to-day, and will map out for ourselves a plan of life quite otherwise than theirs.\nFor many ages to come the old Adam will be so strong in us that everybody will need to do some work if he is to be contented. We shall do more things for ourselves than is usual with the rich to-day, only too glad to have small duties and tasks and routines. But beyond this, we shall endeavour to spread the bread thin on the butter—to make what work there is still to be done to be as widely shared as possible. Three-hour shifts or a fifteen-hour week may put off the problem for a great while. For three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us!\nThere are changes in other spheres too which we must expect to come. When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals. We shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the pseudo-moral principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we have exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues. We shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value. The love of money as a possession—as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life—will be recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease. All kinds of social customs and economic practices, affecting the distribution of wealth and of economic rewards and penalties, which we now maintain at all costs, however distasteful and unjust they may be in themselves, because they are tremendously useful in promoting the accumulation of capital, we shall then be free, at last, to discard.\nOf course there will still be many people with intense, unsatisfied purposiveness who will blindly pursue wealth—unless they can find some plausible substitute. But the rest of us will no longer be under any obligation to applaud and encourage them. For we shall inquire more curiously than is safe to-day into the true character of this “purposiveness” with which in varying degrees Nature has endowed almost all of us. For purposiveness means that we are more concerned with the remote future results of our actions than with their own quality or their immediate effects on our own environment. The “purposive” man is always trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his acts by pushing his interest in them forward into time. He does not love his cat, but his cat’s kittens; nor, in truth, the kittens, but only the kittens’ kittens, and so on forward for ever to the end of cat-dom. For him jam is not jam unless it is a case of jam to-morrow and never jam to-day. Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality.\nLet me remind you of the Professor in Sylvie and Bruno:—\n\n“Only the tailor, sir, with your little bill,” said a meek voice outside the door.\n“Ah, well, I can soon settle his business,” the Professor said to the children, “if you’ll just wait a minute. How much is it, this year, my man?” The tailor had come in while he was speaking.\n“Well, it’s been a-doubling so many years, you see,” the tailor replied, a little gruffly, “and I think I’d like the money now. It’s two thousand pound, it is!”\n“Oh, that’s nothing!” the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him. “But wouldn’t you like to wait just another year and make it four thousand? Just think how rich you’d be! Why, you might be a king, if you liked!”\n“I don’t know as I’d care about being a king,” the man said thoughtfully. “But it dewsound a powerful sight o’ money! Well, I think I’ll wait——”\n“Of course you will!” said the Professor. “There’s good sense in you, I see. Good-day to you, my man!”\n“Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds?” Sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor.\n“Never, my child!” the Professor replied emphatically. “He’ll go on doubling it till he dies. You see, it’s always worth while waiting another year to get twice as much money!”\n\nPerhaps it is not an accident that the race which did most to bring the promise of immortality into the heart and essence of our religions has also done most for the principle of compound interest and particularly loves this most purposive of human institutions.\nI see us free, therefore, to return to some of the most sure and certain principles of religion and traditional virtue—that avarice is a vice, that the exaction of usury is a misdemeanour, and the love of money is detestable, that those walk most truly in the paths of virtue and sane wisdom who take least thought for the morrow. We shall once more value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful. We shall honour those who can teach us how to pluck the hour and the day virtuously and well, the delightful people who are capable of taking direct enjoyment in things, the lilies of the field who toil not, neither do they spin.\nBut beware! The time for all this is not yet. For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to every one that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still. For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight.\nI look forward, therefore, in days not so very remote, to the greatest change which has ever occurred in the material environment of life for human beings in the aggregate. But, of course, it will all happen gradually, not as a catastrophe. Indeed, it has already begun. The course of affairs will simply be that there will be ever larger and larger classes and groups of people from whom problems of economic necessity have been practically removed. The critical difference will be realised when this condition has become so general that the nature of one’s duty to one’s neighbour is changed. For it will remain reasonable to be economically purposive for others after it has ceased to be reasonable for oneself.\nThe pace at which we can reach our destination of economic bliss will be governed by four things—our power to control population, our determination to avoid wars and civil dissensions, our willingness to entrust to science the direction of those matters which are properly the concern of science, and the rate of accumulation as fixed by the margin between our production and our consumption; of which the last will easily look after itself, given the first three.\nMeanwhile there will be no harm in making mild preparations for our destiny, in encouraging, and experimenting in, the arts of life as well as the activities of purpose.\nBut, chiefly, do not let us overestimate the importance of the economic problem, or sacrifice to its supposed necessities other matters of greater and more permanent significance. It should be a matter for specialists—like dentistry. If economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent people, on a level with dentists, that would be splendid!"
