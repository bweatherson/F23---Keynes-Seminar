    "section": "Foundations of Probability",
    "text": "Foundations of Probability\nKeynes’s 1921 book, A Treatise on Probability, is the foundation of work in formal epistemology in the last 100 years. It’s not as widely read today as it might be, because it was quickly surpassed in popularity by Ramsey’s pragmatist approach to probability. But it has three big advantages over Ramsey’s work. (Which is not to deny that Ramsey’s work also has distinct virtues; the aim here is to get everyone to read more, not to stop reading Ramsey.)\nOne is that it works out a lot of the interesting questions that arise from applying probability theory to problems in epistemology in much more detail than Ramsey does. This is largely a consequence of Keynes writing a book and Ramsey writing a handful of papers, only one of which is really widely read in philosophy of probability. But it’s still useful to see the original workings out of various problems in a probabilistic framework.\nAnother is that it develops the notion of weight, and with it some interesting ideas for the limits of the application of probability to human problems. Exactly what Keynesian weight is supposed to be, indeed whether there is anything coherent in it at all, is a tricky question. And it’s also a tricky question whether it has any practical significance. But Keynes clearly thought it did, and the notion makes a surprise guest appearance at a key point in his economic work.\nFinally, Keynes’s work grows out of a broad metaphysical picture, roughly Moorean realism, that is both more popular nowadays than Ramsey’s pragmatism/positivism, and is, at least in my opinion, more plausible. At least some of the early criticisms of Keynes were simply based in the incompatibility between his work and positivism. But that, most of us think these days, is a virtue not a vice. So it’s worthwhile revisiting what a realist approach to probability looks like."

One question that’s fascinating to me is whether there are places where we can see real connections between Keynes’s philosophical work, his theoretical work in economics, and his practical suggestions. Given how influential his practical suggestions were for half a century, the historical questions about the influence of philosophy on the world seem fascinating."

    "text": "Philosophical Questions in Economics\nThe previous point was about the influence from philosophy to economics, and hence to the wider world. But we should think about the reverse direction of influence too, and here Keynes’s work is again helpful. His economic writings include a lot of work on what we’d now call social metaphysics, including really interesting thoughts on the metaphysics of money, and the nature of inflation. He has a lot to say about questions about pooling, as in forming a group belief state, or value function, from individual believers or valuers. (Some of the work on the nature of inflation is relevant here too; similar questions arise.) And his work on developing the concepts that are the centre of contemporary economic statistics, things like GDP, is a fascinating case study in conceptual engineering."

    "section": "History of Philosophy",
    "text": "History of Philosophy\nKeynes was an undergraduate at Cambridge in the early 1900s. In the decades before he arrived, philosophy and Cambridge (and to some extent across the UK) was a cross between what we’d now call PPE, and what we’d now call Cognitive Science. Henry Sidgwick was the dominant force at Cambridge, and the most important economists (as we’d now call them) of that time looked up to him. Keynes’s father wrote two books - one in economics and one in logic. Psychology at Cambridge was a subdiscipline of philosophy, on a part with metaphysics and ethics, and most important people you read in it were James and Dewey. And that movement back and forth between what we’d now call economics, psychology, and philosophy was completely common.\nBy the time Keynes died, philosophy had not only excluded economics and psychology (which has left to form their own thriving programs), it had largely lost interest in normative ethics and, especially, political philosophy. Since this time (and this place) are so central to the story analytic philosophy tells itself about how philosophy in the 20th century came to be, it’s fascinating to look at it through the lens of someone who started in philosophy, but ended up doing work that was off the radar of professional philosophers by the middle of the century.\nAt my most controversial, I sometimes think we should date the start of analytic philosophy not to Frege and Russell’s work on logic and mathematics, but to the work of Sidgwick, Jevons, and Marshall on what we’d now call formal epistemology/formal ethics. I’m really not going to defend that view in the seminar, I don’t even really believe it when stated that strongly. What I do think is that a history of analytic philosophy that gives moral and political philosophy, and philosophers, a more central place is a very worthwhile project. And Keynes’s life, and his wonderfully written biographies of figures in the generation that came before him, would be central to such a history."

    "text": "Political Philosophy\nKeynes never wrote a work in theoretical political philosophy. But he did write a number of works in what we might call applied political philosophy, including the most influential political book of its time, his critique of the Paris Peace Treaty. His political writings generate two fascinating questions. One is just what his political philosophy was. It’s a version of liberalism, and the simplest thing to say is that he fits alongside Constant and de Tocqueville as a liberal writing in revolutionary times. But it’s in at least some respects more radical than either of them, and it’s not easy to say exactly how his view fits into the history of political thought. A second question is whether his view is worth defending. At times he looks like someone who has seen the massive gains in well-being for a select group of people in the previous few decades, and wants to know how we can keep making further such gains, and make them available to more people. At others he looks like someone whose primary interest is in preserving what remains of the British Empire. We’ll spend a bit of time on both these questions in the seminar, though not in as much detail as we might. I think to answer either fully we’d need to really dig into the details of financial negotiations, and look at what political philosophy is pushing Keynes to try to steer the negotiations this way rather than that. And I don’t have the expertise (or the time) to explain enough of what was going on in these negotiations to do that. But it’s a question that is there in the background, and political questions will never be entirely removed from what we’re studying."

His biographical essays often include long discussions of the lineage of the subject, explaining their intellectual successes as a consequence of their ancestry. And he adored Galton, who seemed at time to rival only Einstein as his contemporary intellectual heroes."

He was aware of how racist the US was, especially in the south, and it made him personally uncomfortable when he was directly confronted with it on his travels. But he didn’t actually do anything about this discomfort, even though his contacts with FDR meant that he could possibly have done something. The urge to protest that was so vivid on other fields seems to have gone missing here. I suspect they are there somewhere, but I haven’t found any particular racist comments about Blacks, either from Africa or the Americas, in Keynes’s writings. What we get instead is that Blacks are almost invisible to him. They aren’t his concern. I don’t really know what a contemporary parallel to this is. I don’t mean this to be exculpatory; it’s obviously not great to just not care about a huge percentage of humanity. But it’s not the kind of racism you might expect."

    "text": "Anti-Semitism\nOn the other hand, he did make some terribly anti-semitic remarks. You see some of them already in “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren”, and there are worse remarks included in one of the pieces on Einstein in Essays in Biography.\nThis was obviously not just a case of indifference. Keynes interacted with many Jewish people. Here are just four prominent examples, though we could pick more. He employed Leonard Woolf for a while, effectively subsidising Virginia’s writing. He did a lot of work to deal with Wittgenstein’s many foibles. (I can’t prove this, but I really think he thought of his relationship with Wittgenstein as an echo of Hume’s relationship with Rousseau.) His closest collaborator in the 1930s was Richard Kahn, probably the one person Keynes most identified as being his student. (Kahn developed the concept of the multiplier, which became so central to practical applications of Keynes’s work.) And the name of his most important book was chosen as a deliberate homage to Einstein’s work.\nAnd despite all these personal interactions, he still managed to harbour some awful general attitudes about Jews as a group. I honestly don’t know how much this affected his personal interactions with individual people. There is some evidence that it damaged his relationship with Leonard Woolf, but it’s sketchy. It’s mostly just depressing that someone smart enough to know better, and with so much relevant evidence from personal acquaintances, could still fall into believing lazy stereotypes.\nKeynes had a lot more stereotypical beliefs (in both senses) about people from various European countries, with the stereotypes he had about French, German, and Welsh people being possibly the most notable in the ways they affected his work. On the whole these didn’t seem as pernicious to me, and instead point to interesting questions about where we draw the line between lazy stereotyping, and carefully observing general characteristics. There is something like a trigger warning before some of the papers in later versions of Essays in Biography on these points, though it seems unnecessary to me. In any case, I haven’t found anything in his generalisations about other European countries that’s nearly as appalling as the anti-semitic views he occasionally let slip out."

    "title": "Week 1: Keynes’s Life",
    "section": "The Moral Sciences Tripos",
    "text": "The Moral Sciences Tripos\nIn the late 19th century, if you were a Cambridge student interested in philosophy very broadly construed, the degree you took was called Moral Sciences. It was officially called the Moral Sciences Tripos, but exactly what a Tripos is, and why it was called that, don’t matter that much to our story. What matters is that it was a three year degree, and it was centred around examinations at the end of the second and third year.\nNote that this is in England, so it’s the English university system. And that’s a bit different to what you might be used to in America, Australia, Canada, Scotland, or elsewhere in the English speaking world. In England, in Keynes’s time as now, undergraduates take all their courses in the subject they are taking their degree in. I think this is part of the appeal of degrees like PPE in England; it means that students aren’t quite so concentrated. But it also means that just the sheer number of courses means that most students take a lot of courses in almost every sub-discipline of their degree. Relatedly, students in Moral Sciences were expected to complete a common exam, which covered the whole of the discipline.\nAnd what was the discipline of moral sciences? The best guide I’ve found is an 1891 student’s guide to the University of Cambridge, which includes a lot of advice for students taking Moral Sciences. That’s a little hard to read, but thankfully Irwin Collier, who has a fantastic site on archival artifacts from the history of economics has made an HTML version of the Moral Sciences part. He notes that Keynes, i.e., John Neville Keynes, contributed to the part of the guide on political economy. The guide describes in some detail what students should know for the two big exams, with this being the important overview.\n\nThe examination for the Moral Sciences Tripos consists of two parts; and begins, as a rule, upon the Monday after the last Sunday but one in May. No student may present himself for both parts in the same year. The first part consists of two papers on each of the following subjects: Psychology including Ethical Psychology; Logic and Methodology; Political Economy; together with a paper of Essays. …\nThe subjects of the second part of the examination fall into two groups:–(A) Metaphysics, Political Philosophy, Ethics–on each of which there is one paper–and (B) the following special subjects, History of Philosophy, Advanced Logic and Methodology, Advanced Psychology and Psychophysics, Advanced Political Economy. There are two papers on each of these special subjects besides an Essay paper containing questions on all the above subjects. Every student must take one, and may not take more than two, of the special subjects; also every student must take the papers on Metaphysics and Ethics except those who select Advanced Political Economy as a special subject: for such students the paper on Political Philosophy is provided as an alternative for Metaphysics.\n\nSo that’s what you had to do: psychology (including what we’d now call moral psychology), logic, politics/economics, and then in senior year, metaphysics (though you can opt out of that), political philosophy, ethics, history of philosophy, and advanced versions of the earlier material. Metaphysics, by the way, means largely what we’d call epistemology. The first topic is “Knowledge, its analysis and general characteristics: material and formal elements of knowledge; self-consciousness as unifying principle; uniformity and continuity of experience.”, and there are several more about certainty, coordination (social epistemology!), and others. Again, you can follow the links to see the details in what the parts that would now be considered philosophy consist in.\nThe economics and psychology parts are shot through with names that we’d consider philosophers. The economics section lists (John Stuart) Mill, Sidgwick, Jevons, (John Neville) Keynes, and, of course, Smith. The psychology section has Dewey and James as the most important figures. If you think about contemporary philosophy departments, this shouldn’t be a surprise. It’s natural that people in philosophy, as it is construed at a time, will know a lot about philosophy, as it is construed at that time. And at the time, philosophy included pretty much all of what we’d now call Cognitive Science, and pretty much all of what we’d now call PPE. (Michigan Philosophy is, in this respect, trying to return philosophy to its former glory.)\nBut a lot changed in 1903. It was a big year for Cambridge Moral Sciences. Moore published Principia Ethica, a book we’ll talk a lot about in this course. Russell published The Principles of Mathematics, which we won’t talk about at all after this sentence. And a campaign led by Alfred Marshall, but opposed by many others, finally succeeded in breaking off Economics from Moral Sciences, and creating its own tripos (i.e., degree).\nThis didn’t affect Maynard Keynes directly; he was a mathematics undergraduate. But it had a massive effect on his overall life. For one thing, it complicated his father’s position; when the split happened he naturally went into Economics, but it probably led to him doing less philosophical work than he otherwise might have. (Remember he had written the most important logic book of the years immediately preceding Frege and Russell.) But it also led to complications for Maynard’s position. He had obvious leanings towards economics, not least because he wanted to work in Treasury. But he also wanted to work on, for related reasons, Moorean ethics, and the foundations of probability. All of this would have been easier in the old Moral Sciences program than it was in the world that was created by the split. We shouldn’t overstate this - interaction between departments at Cambridge has always been very strong compared to other places, and it certainly didn’t stop Keynes talking with Russell about probability, or Edgeworth publishing on probability in Mind. And Keynes spent a lot of time (really, a lot of time) with Wittgenstein, so it wasn’t like he was out of the loop in philosophy. Still, I can’t help wonder what his career would have looked like had it been spent entirely in a department centred around philosophy.\nI’m going over this all at some length in part because it is so important to Keynes’s intellectual background, but in part because it seems more important to the history of analytic philosophy than is usually accounted for. I don’t know how much it comes up these days, but until circa 2010, the standard introductory course in a US analytic philosophy program (the pro-sem) was typically a course on the foundations of analytic philosophy, with a special focus on Frege, Russell, and (early) Wittgenstein. You saw variations on this theme, maybe some Moore here, some late Wittgenstein there, often some Kripke to make it more contemporary, but that was the basic idea. And so much of that story is taking place at Cambridge, in this middle of which the department these folks are in goes through this big split.\nOne thing you might notice from that list of names is that, with the partial exception of Moore, there isn’t much ethics there, and no political philosophy. (And it’s Moore’s meta-ethics, or his metaphysics and epistemology, that were covered in these courses, not his normative ethics. Of course Russell had a lot to say about politics, and political philosophy, but that’s not read much in contemporary philosophy.) Given how central Sidgwick was to the previous generation of Cambridge philosophers, that’s something of a surprise. I really don’t have the evidence for this, but it’s a speculation. One thing that I’ve seen after the few department splits I know about (Sydney in the 1960s, Irvine more recently) is that subjects that are sort of between the specialisations of the new department get a little left out. It’s more common to see neither department do them than to see both. I wonder how much losing political economy meant that the remaining philosophers thought that political philosophy wasn’t part of their jurisdiction any more, and/or that the people who might have been the Cambridge moral and political philosophers of the early 20th century simply moved departments in the split. As I said, I don’t really know if this is even a viable theory, but I think the split is an important and under-discussed part of a really significant moment in the history of philosophy."

    "section": "The Three Party System",
    "text": "The Three Party System\nTo understand some of the political debates that Keynes is involved with, it helps to have a sense of the political parties at the time. Great Britain had, for most of Keynes’s life, something like a three party system. I say “Great Britain” here because (a) the same parties were strong in England, Scotland and Wales, but quite different parties were strong in Ireland. But Keynes had next to nothing to say on Irish matters, and I’ll ignore the Irish parties from now on.\nFrom right to left, the three parties were the Conservative, or Tory, Party, the Liberal Party, and the Labour Party. You can get a bit of a sense of their strengths over time from this graph of the number of seats in the House of Commons they had after each election from 1895-1979. (though we’ll come back to why this is potentially misleading in a bit).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this was much more of a two-party system when Keynes was younger. I haven’t included them here, but the main Irish party had more members of the House of Commons than Labour for most of the time until Irish independence after WWI. Still, Labour was there, and after WWI became more and more important.\nKeynes was by inclination, upbringing, and social class, a Liberal. Indeed he was one of the more prominent Liberal public intellectuals for much of his life. For many of his political projects, convincing his fellow Liberals that he was right was a key part of his strategy. (Though he also often worked by trying to convince technocrats.) I believe he voted Liberal at every election in his life except 1945, when like practically everyone else he voted Labour.\nI’ve said that the parties could be arranged right-to-left, and that’s roughly right, but only roughly. The Conservatives were in some ways more religiously tolerant than the Liberals. They were much less anti-Catholic, going back to the two parties views on the Glorious Revolution. And they had a Jewish leader, Disraeli, which it is hard to imagine the Liberals having done. More importantly for our story, one of the big divisions between the parties was on trade. The Liberals were, almost as a matter of identity, pro-free trade, while the Conservatives were more protectionist. I don’t know how free-trade versus protectionism gets coded as left/right these days, but certainly at some times it has been coded as free-trade being the right-wing view here. When Keynes suggested that tariffs might be part of the best response to the Great Depression, this was as large a break from Liberal orthodoxy as he made any time in his life.\nNow there is one important sense in which everything I’ve said here was a bit misleading. From 1916 to 1926, the Liberal party was split into two factions, one organised around Asquith (the PM until 1916), and the other around Lloyd George (the PM after 1916). The two factions, although still in some sense part of the same party, contested elections against each other. Keynes was originally on Asquith’s side (because he agreed with Asquith about how to conduct the war, and then importantly about Versailles) but eventually switched to Lloyd George’s side (because of how hostile Asquith was to the general strike).\nIt’s also worth noting how much tighter the connection between academia and politics was in those days. Asquith, who was PM from 1908-1916, had a post-doc at Oxford. And Arthur Balfour, one of the most important Conservatives of the first two decades of the 20th Century, and for a short time PM himself, was a philosopher. He wrote several articles in Mind, as well as a book critically surveying the popular philosophical views of the late 19th century. His criticisms of idealism anticipate in some respects Moore’s more famous criticisms. And Balfour’s connections to philosophy proved very helpful to philosophers who got themselves into high profile scraps. He couldn’t keep Russell out of prison during WWI, but he did intervene to make sure Russell got particularly lenient treatment.\nKeynes seems to have had a real visceral dislike for most Conservatives. See for instance this rather pointed passage from his obituary for Asquith.\n\nHis temperament was naturally conservative. With a little stupidity and a few prejudices dashed in he would have been Conservative in the political sense also.\n\nBut Keynes’s obituary for Balfour, while somewhat impersonal, is very generous in its intellectual praise, favourably comparing Balfour’s early economic work in the 1890s to that of the more famous economists of the time."

    "section": "Britain’s Economy Between the Wars",
    "text": "Britain’s Economy Between the Wars\nIf you grew up in Australia or America, and you heard anything about economic history, you probably heard about the Roaring 20s, and the Great Depression of the 1930s. After a decade of unbelievable prosperity, it all came crashing down. The numbers certainly bear that out. We don’t have exact statistics for this period, in part because the conceptual engineering that Keynes and others did to construct the statistics we now rely on hadn’t been done. (I don’t know these debates very well, but my sense is that Keynes often lost; he was causally relevant to the prominence of the statistics we now rely on, but not always in the way he intended.) Nevertheless, we can make rough estimates of inflation and unemployment, and this tells us something about the US economy. (Estimates about Australia seem even more fuzzy, so we’ll stick to America.)\nFirst inflation. These are the annual inflation rates according to the records of the Minneapolis Fed (who are in turn relying on the BLS).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a bit surprising how low inflation is in the 1920s, after the weirdness of prices bouncing all over the place after the war. (They also spiked after the two biggest supply chain disruptions of the last 100 years, World War II and the COVID pandemic. In each case prices never came back to pre-disruption levels, but inflation subsided fairly quickly.)\nUnemployment tells a clearer story. The following table is a screenshot from Gene Smiley’s 1983 paper “Recent Unemployment Rate Estimates for the 1920s and 1930s”.\n\n\n\nEstimates of unemployment in the US between the World Wars.\n\n\nThere isn’t a standard way of measuring unemployment at the time, in part because of disagreements about how to classify people in New Deal “work relief” programs. Darby counts them as employed, while most statisticians do not. But however we think about that question, two things stand out from columns 5 to 7, which I think are the closest to current statistics. The first is that after the complications of demobilisation (and a pandemic), unemployment was fairly low through the 1920s. The second is that no matter what you think about work relief, things were completely horrible for workers in the 1930s. (Though apparently if one had a job, wages did not in fact fall, a point that’s important for chapter 2 of the General Theory.)\nThe big thing I want to stress in this appendix is that the situation in the UK was very very different to this. Again, we’ll start with inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld War I was a catastrophe for prices in the UK; by the time things settled down prices were two-and-a-half times what they were at the start of the war. There was a push both from politicians and (I suspect) the public to get not just inflation but prices down. And they did this, and it was a crisis. There was first a huge deflation (getting rid of the ‘half’ in the ‘two-and-a-half’ price rise) then somewhere between price stability and deflation every year until rearmament gets seriously under way in the late 1930s. What does this do to unemployment? Now that we have Keynes we’d expect it would be brutal, and well, it was brutal. It isn’t easy to get the data, but the best estimate I’ve found is a recent estimate by Meredith Baker in her paper “Re-Evaluating British Unemployment Between the Wars”. Here’s a screenshot of her summary finding.\n\n\n\nUK unemployment from 1920-1936 (via Meredith Baker)\n\n\nNow the 1930s are definitely worse than the 1920s; the graph does go up as the decade changes. But the 1920s were not actually good. The dislocation of ending the war produced as much unemployment as the Depression. And while a bit more than half of that was transitory, unemployment barely dropped below 10% for the decade. If you’re used to thinking of 10% unemployment as the border between things being merely bad and it being a full-blown crisis, you’d say that Britain was in crisis for practically the entire interwar period.\nThis matters to our story because it’s hard to make sense of what Keynes was saying in the late 1920s if your worldview is American (or Australian). A common caricature of Keynes is that he supported unlimited government spending in all circumstances. And he certainly was in favour of big public works programs in the late 1920s. But this wasn’t because he thought these were always called for; it was because the crisis was entering its second decade. This is all important context for Keynes’s 1930 paper Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren, which we’ll look at next time."

    "text": "I\nWe are suffering just now from a bad attack of economic pessimism. It is common to hear people say that the epoch of enormous economic progress which characterised the nineteenth century is over; that the rapid improvement in the standard of life is now going to slow down—at any rate in Great Britain; that a decline in prosperity is more likely than an improvement in the decade which lies ahead of us.\nI believe that this is a wildly mistaken interpretation of what is happening to us. We are suffering, not from the rheumatics of old age, but from the growing-pains of over-rapid changes, from the painfulness of readjustment between one economic period and another. The increase of technical efficiency has been taking place faster than we can deal with the problem of labour absorption; the improvement in the standard of life has been a little too quick; the banking and monetary system of the world has been preventing the rate of interest from falling as fast as equilibrium requires. And even so, the waste and confusion which ensue relate to not more than 7½ per cent of the national income; we are muddling away one and sixpence in the £, and have only 18s. 6d., when we might, if we were more sensible, have £1; yet, nevertheless, the 18s. 6d. mounts up to as much as the £1 would have been five or six years ago. We forget that in 1929 the physical output of the industry of Great Britain was greater than ever before, and that the net surplus of our foreign balance available for new foreign investment, after paying for all our imports, was greater last year than that of any other country, being indeed 50 per cent greater than the corresponding surplus of the United States. Or again—if it is to be a matter of comparisons—suppose that we were to reduce our wages by a half, repudiate four-fifths of the national debt, and hoard our surplus wealth in barren gold instead of lending it at 6 per cent or more, we should resemble the now much-envied France. But would it be an improvement?\nThe prevailing world depression, the enormous anomaly of unemployment in a world full of wants, the disastrous mistakes we have made, blind us to what is going on under the surface—to the true interpretation of the trend of things. For I predict that both of the two opposed errors of pessimism which now make so much noise in the world will be proved wrong in our own time—the pessimism of the revolutionaries who think that things are so bad that nothing can save us but violent change, and the pessimism of the reactionaries who consider the balance of our economic and social life so precarious that we must risk no experiments.\nMy purpose in this essay, however, is not to examine the present or the near future, but to disembarrass myself of short views and take wings into the future. What can we reasonably expect the level of our economic life to be a hundred years hence? What are the economic possibilities for our grandchildren?\nFrom the earliest times of which we have record—back, say, to two thousand years before Christ—down to the beginning of the eighteenth century, there was no very great change in the standard of life of the average man living in the civilised centres of the earth. Ups and downs certainly. Visitations of plague, famine, and war. Golden intervals. But no progressive, violent change. Some periods perhaps 50 per cent better than others—at the utmost 100 per cent better—in the four thousand years which ended (say) in A.D. 1700.\nThis slow rate of progress, or lack of progress, was due to two reasons—to the remarkable absence of important technical improvements and to the failure of capital to accumulate.\nThe absence of important technical inventions between the prehistoric age and comparatively modern times is truly remarkable. Almost everything which really matters and which the world possessed at the commencement of the modern age was already known to man at the dawn of history. Language, fire, the same domestic animals which we have to-day, wheat, barley, the vine and the olive, the plough, the wheel, the oar, the sail, leather, linen and cloth, bricks and pots, gold and silver, copper, tin, and lead—and iron was added to the list before 1000 B.C.—banking, statecraft, mathematics, astronomy, and religion. There is no record of when we first possessed these things.\nAt some epoch before the dawn of history—perhaps even in one of the comfortable intervals before the last ice age—there must have been an era of progress and invention comparable to that in which we live to-day. But through the greater part of recorded history there was nothing of the kind.\nThe modern age opened, I think, with the accumulation of capital which began in the sixteenth century. I believe—for reasons with which I must not encumber the present argument—that this was initially due to the rise of prices, and the profits to which that led, which resulted from the treasure of gold and silver which Spain brought from the New World into the Old. From that time until to-day the power of accumulation by compound interest, which seems to have been sleeping for many generations, was re-born and renewed its strength. And the power of compound interest over two hundred years is such as to stagger the imagination.\nLet me give in illustration of this a sum which I have worked out. The value of Great Britain’s foreign investments to-day is estimated at about £4,000,000,000. This yields us an income at the rate of about 6½ per cent. Half of this we bring home and enjoy; the other half, namely, 3¼ per cent, we leave to accumulate abroad at compound interest. Something of this sort has now been going on for about 250 years.\nFor I trace the beginnings of British foreign investment to the treasure which Drake stole from Spain in 1580. In that year he returned to England bringing with him the prodigious spoils of the Golden Hind. Queen Elizabeth was a considerable shareholder in the syndicate which had financed the expedition. Out of her share she paid off the whole of England’s foreign debt, balanced her Budget, and found herself with about £40,000 in hand. This she invested in the Levant Company—which prospered. Out of the profits of the Levant Company, the East India Company was founded; and the profits of this great enterprise were the foundation of England’s subsequent foreign investment. Now it happens that £40,000 accumulating at 3¼ per cent compound interest approximately corresponds to the actual volume of England’s foreign investments at various dates, and would actually amount to-day to the total of £4,000,000,000 which I have already quoted as being what our foreign investments now are. Thus, every £1 which Drake brought home in 1580 has now become £100,000. Such is the power of compound interest!\nFrom the sixteenth century, with a cumulative crescendo after the eighteenth, the great age of science and technical inventions began, which since the beginning of the nineteenth century has been in full flood—coal, steam, electricity, petrol, steel, rubber, cotton, the chemical industries, automatic machinery and the methods of mass production, wireless, printing, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein, and thousands of other things and men too famous and familiar to catalogue.\nWhat is the result? In spite of an enormous growth in the population of the world, which it has been necessary to equip with houses and machines, the average standard of life in Europe and the United States has been raised, I think, about fourfold. The growth of capital has been on a scale which is far beyond a hundred-fold of what any previous age had known. And from now on we need not expect so great an increase of population.\nIf capital increases, say, 2 per cent per annum, the capital equipment of the world will have increased by a half in twenty years, and seven and a half times in a hundred years. Think of this in terms of material things—houses, transport, and the like.\nAt the same time technical improvements in manufacture and transport have been proceeding at a greater rate in the last ten years than ever before in history. In the United States factory output per head was 40 per cent greater in 1925 than in 1919. In Europe we are held back by temporary obstacles, but even so it is safe to say that technical efficiency is increasing by more than 1 per cent per annum compound. There is evidence that the revolutionary technical changes, which have so far chiefly affected industry, may soon be attacking agriculture. We may be on the eve of improvements in the efficiency of food production as great as those which have already taken place in mining, manufacture, and transport. In quite a few years—in our own lifetimes I mean—we may be able to perform all the operations of agriculture, mining, and manufacture with a quarter of the human effort to which we have been accustomed.\nFor the moment the very rapidity of these changes is hurting us and bringing difficult problems to solve. Those countries are suffering relatively which are not in the vanguard of progress. We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come—namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.\nBut this is only a temporary phase of maladjustment. All this means in the long run that mankind is solving its economic problem. I would predict that the standard of life in progressive countries one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as it is to-day. There would be nothing surprising in this even in the light of our present knowledge. It would not be foolish to contemplate the possibility of a far greater progress still.\n\n\nII\nLet us, for the sake of argument, suppose that a hundred years hence we are all of us, on the average, eight times better off in the economic sense than we are to-day. Assuredly there need be nothing here to surprise us.\nNow it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be insatiable. But they fall into two classes—those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not so true of the absolute needs—a point may soon be reached, much sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes.\nNow for my conclusion, which you will find, I think, to become more and more startling to the imagination the longer you think about it.\nI draw the conclusion that, assuming no important wars and no important increase in population, the economic problem may be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years. This means that the economic problem is not—if we look into the future—the permanent problem of the human race.\nWhy, you may ask, is this so startling? It is startling because—if, instead of looking into the future, we look into the past—we find that the economic problem, the struggle for subsistence, always has been hitherto the primary, most pressing problem of the human race—not only of the human race, but of the whole of the biological kingdom from the beginnings of life in its most primitive forms.\nThus we have been expressly evolved by nature—with all our impulses and deepest instincts—for the purpose of solving the economic problem. If the economic problem is solved, mankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose.\nWill this be a benefit? If one believes at all in the real values of life, the prospect at least opens up the possibility of benefit. Yet I think with dread of the readjustment of the habits and instincts of the ordinary man, bred into him for countless generations, which he may be asked to discard within a few decades.\nTo use the language of to-day—must we not expect a general “nervous breakdown”? We already have a little experience of what I mean—a nervous breakdown of the sort which is already common enough in England and the United States amongst the wives of the well-to-do classes, unfortunate women, many of them, who have been deprived by their wealth of their traditional tasks and occupations—who cannot find it sufficiently amusing, when deprived of the spur of economic necessity, to cook and clean and mend, yet are quite unable to find anything more amusing.\nTo those who sweat for their daily bread leisure is a longed-for sweet—until they get it.\nThere is the traditional epitaph written for herself by the old charwoman:—\n\nDon’t mourn for me, friends, don’t weep for me never,\nFor I’m going to do nothing for ever and ever.\n\nThis was her heaven. Like others who look forward to leisure, she conceived how nice it would be to spend her time listening-in—for there was another couplet which occurred in her poem:—\n\nWith psalms and sweet music the heavens’ll be ringing,\nBut I shall have nothing to do with the singing.\n\nYet it will only be for those who have to do with the singing that life will be tolerable—and how few of us can sing!\nThus for the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem—how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.\nThe strenuous purposeful money-makers may carry all of us along with them into the lap of economic abundance. But it will be those peoples, who can keep alive, and cultivate into a fuller perfection, the art of life itself and do not sell themselves for the means of life, who will be able to enjoy the abundance when it comes.\nYet there is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy. It is a fearful problem for the ordinary person, with no special talents, to occupy himself, especially if he no longer has roots in the soil or in custom or in the beloved conventions of a traditional society. To judge from the behaviour and the achievements of the wealthy classes to-day in any quarter of the world, the outlook is very depressing! For these are, so to speak, our advance guard—those who are spying out the promised land for the rest of us and pitching their camp there. For they have most of them failed disastrously, so it seems to me—those who have an independent income but no associations or duties or ties—to solve the problem which has been set them.\nI feel sure that with a little more experience we shall use the new-found bounty of nature quite differently from the way in which the rich use it to-day, and will map out for ourselves a plan of life quite otherwise than theirs.\nFor many ages to come the old Adam will be so strong in us that everybody will need to do some work if he is to be contented. We shall do more things for ourselves than is usual with the rich to-day, only too glad to have small duties and tasks and routines. But beyond this, we shall endeavour to spread the bread thin on the butter—to make what work there is still to be done to be as widely shared as possible. Three-hour shifts or a fifteen-hour week may put off the problem for a great while. For three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us!\nThere are changes in other spheres too which we must expect to come. When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals. We shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the pseudo-moral principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we have exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues. We shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value. The love of money as a possession—as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life—will be recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease. All kinds of social customs and economic practices, affecting the distribution of wealth and of economic rewards and penalties, which we now maintain at all costs, however distasteful and unjust they may be in themselves, because they are tremendously useful in promoting the accumulation of capital, we shall then be free, at last, to discard.\nOf course there will still be many people with intense, unsatisfied purposiveness who will blindly pursue wealth—unless they can find some plausible substitute. But the rest of us will no longer be under any obligation to applaud and encourage them. For we shall inquire more curiously than is safe to-day into the true character of this “purposiveness” with which in varying degrees Nature has endowed almost all of us. For purposiveness means that we are more concerned with the remote future results of our actions than with their own quality or their immediate effects on our own environment. The “purposive” man is always trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his acts by pushing his interest in them forward into time. He does not love his cat, but his cat’s kittens; nor, in truth, the kittens, but only the kittens’ kittens, and so on forward for ever to the end of cat-dom. For him jam is not jam unless it is a case of jam to-morrow and never jam to-day. Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality.\nLet me remind you of the Professor in Sylvie and Bruno:—\n\n“Only the tailor, sir, with your little bill,” said a meek voice outside the door.\n“Ah, well, I can soon settle his business,” the Professor said to the children, “if you’ll just wait a minute. How much is it, this year, my man?” The tailor had come in while he was speaking.\n“Well, it’s been a-doubling so many years, you see,” the tailor replied, a little gruffly, “and I think I’d like the money now. It’s two thousand pound, it is!”\n“Oh, that’s nothing!” the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him. “But wouldn’t you like to wait just another year and make it four thousand? Just think how rich you’d be! Why, you might be a king, if you liked!”\n“I don’t know as I’d care about being a king,” the man said thoughtfully. “But it dewsound a powerful sight o’ money! Well, I think I’ll wait——”\n“Of course you will!” said the Professor. “There’s good sense in you, I see. Good-day to you, my man!”\n“Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds?” Sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor.\n“Never, my child!” the Professor replied emphatically. “He’ll go on doubling it till he dies. You see, it’s always worth while waiting another year to get twice as much money!”\n\nPerhaps it is not an accident that the race which did most to bring the promise of immortality into the heart and essence of our religions has also done most for the principle of compound interest and particularly loves this most purposive of human institutions.\nI see us free, therefore, to return to some of the most sure and certain principles of religion and traditional virtue—that avarice is a vice, that the exaction of usury is a misdemeanour, and the love of money is detestable, that those walk most truly in the paths of virtue and sane wisdom who take least thought for the morrow. We shall once more value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful. We shall honour those who can teach us how to pluck the hour and the day virtuously and well, the delightful people who are capable of taking direct enjoyment in things, the lilies of the field who toil not, neither do they spin.\nBut beware! The time for all this is not yet. For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to every one that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still. For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight.\nI look forward, therefore, in days not so very remote, to the greatest change which has ever occurred in the material environment of life for human beings in the aggregate. But, of course, it will all happen gradually, not as a catastrophe. Indeed, it has already begun. The course of affairs will simply be that there will be ever larger and larger classes and groups of people from whom problems of economic necessity have been practically removed. The critical difference will be realised when this condition has become so general that the nature of one’s duty to one’s neighbour is changed. For it will remain reasonable to be economically purposive for others after it has ceased to be reasonable for oneself.\nThe pace at which we can reach our destination of economic bliss will be governed by four things—our power to control population, our determination to avoid wars and civil dissensions, our willingness to entrust to science the direction of those matters which are properly the concern of science, and the rate of accumulation as fixed by the margin between our production and our consumption; of which the last will easily look after itself, given the first three.\nMeanwhile there will be no harm in making mild preparations for our destiny, in encouraging, and experimenting in, the arts of life as well as the activities of purpose.\nBut, chiefly, do not let us overestimate the importance of the economic problem, or sacrifice to its supposed necessities other matters of greater and more permanent significance. It should be a matter for specialists—like dentistry. If economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent people, on a level with dentists, that would be splendid!"

    "text": "I’m doing a seminar on John Maynard Keynes this fall (i.e., Fall 2023), at the University of Michigan. And because I’m old-fashioned, I thought I’d have a blog for the seminar. Apparently blogs these days have pictures, so here’s a famous picture of Keynes.\n\n\n\n1934 Cartoon of Keynes by David Low\n\n\nI’m a philosopher, and this is a philosophy seminar, so the course will be primarily about things that are philosophy in some very broad sense. We’re not going to get into the details of the Clearing Union, for example. But one thing I want to do with the seminar is stress how many different ways there are to be a philosopher, so we’ll stretch the limits a little bit of what is sometimes covered in philosophy. Still, a big focus will be on Keynes’s main work that is unquestionably an important philosophical work, the Treatise on Probability.\nHere is the tentative schedule for the seminar, which is very much subject to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDate\nReading\n\n\n\n\n1\nAugust 28, 2023\nNone (intro)\n\n\nOff\nSeptember 4, 2023\nNone (Labor Day)\n\n\n2\nSeptember 11, 2023\nMy Early Beliefs.\nEconomic Possibilities for our Grandchildren.\n\n\n3\nSeptember 18, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 1-3\n\n\n4\nSeptember 25, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 4-5\n\n\n5\nOctober 2, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 6-9\n\n\n6\nOctober 9, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 18-20 (maybe also 21-23 if time)\n\n\nOff\nOctober 16, 2023\nNone (Fall Break)\n\n\n7\nOctober 23, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Ch. 26\nBroad’s review of TP\n\n\n8\nOctober 30, 2023\nCritics of TP: Edgeworth, Ramsey, Feigl\n\n\n9\nNovember 6, 2023\nGeneral Theory Chs. 1, 2, 24 (23, optional)\n\n\n10\nNovember 13, 2023\nGeneral Theory.

Keynes works at a time and place that is often taken to be a turning point in the history of philosophy. I think his work represents a kind of path not taken for philosophy. There is a possible world where moral and political philosophy, and perhaps even political economy more broadly, is just as central to twentieth century Anglophone philosophy as it was to nineteenth century Anglophone philosophy. Just how and why that didn’t happen is I think an interesting question, and looking at Keynes is possibly one interesting way into it. But it would require someone with a much better grasp of academic history than me to teach such a course, so it will be an idea hovering around without ever quite being the focus."

One thing I want to think about over this seminar is how to write philosophically. In other classes you’ll probably cover some things on how to do well within the genre of the contemporary philosophy journal article, and look at what we think are the standout instances of the form. I want to spend at least a little bit in this class reading and thinking outside that genre. So today we have a memoir, and a piece of popular rhetoric.\nIt’s been very tempting in writing these notes to treat them as typical philosophy papers, and ask what’s the thesis statement, what’s the argument for that thesis, and so on. But I’ve tried to not just do that; while that approach has value, it might also lack something important. And maybe we can do something about that lack if we treat these papers on their own terms."

    "section": "Philosophical Background",
    "text": "Philosophical Background\nIt’s widely, if not universally, believed that there was something like a philosophical revolution around Cambridge, around the start of the twentieth century, launching something that became known as analytic philosophy. Just what that revolution consisted in, just what made analytic philosophy different from what came before, and which things that came after are still part of analytic philosophy, are all matters of considerable dispute. But the following theses all have non-trivial amounts of support.\n\nAnalytic philosophy is the research program launched by the work of the German mathematician Gottlob Frege (1848-1925), the English philosophers Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) and G. E. Moore (1873-1959), and the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951). The latter three were all based in Cambridge for much of their life, and they all had important interactions with Keynes. Just how central Moore is to this story varies; some commentators stress Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein as central, others put Russell and Moore as the central characters.\nAnalytic philosophy is based in analysis (as the name suggests). That is, it takes as a central task the idea of breaking down notions into their constituent parts as a guide to philosophical understanding and progress. The central metaphor here is chemical analysis, not real analysis in mathematics, or psycho-analysis.\nAnalytic philosophy is launched by the (undeniable) revolution in logic that Frege started, and Russell continued/popularised, and the (somewhat more contentious) rejection of idealism by Moore and (later) Russell. Idealism here is a very technical term; it refers to metaphysical theories that say the world is fundamentally mental, i.e., in some sense made of ideas. It’s not a theory about ideals or values, at least in the first instance. Just what idealism is, and whether there were good reasons to reject the things it might have been, remain matters of some dispute. But there is a linguistic claim that is completely beyond dispute: at the start of the twentieth century a huge proportion of philosophers in Britain would have described themselves as “idealists”; by the end almost none of them would have.\nAnalytic philosophy was primarily a revolution in philosophical work in logic, language, metaphysics, epistemology, and mind. It wasn’t particularly concerned with ethics, and it certainly wasn’t concerned with normative ethics. My (probably controversial) view is that one couldn’t possibly say that ethics was part of the analytic revolution because then you’d have to explain what was distinctively about 20th century ethics that wasn’t already there in Sidgwick and/or Marshall, and that’s not really possible. But set that point aside; the history of analytic is not a field given to consensus, but that the early analytic folks made little significant contribution to moral and political philosophy is widely agreed.\n\nAll of this makes the role of Principia Ethica, the book at the centre of “My Early Beliefs”, so mysterious. It is, obviously, by G. E. Moore, one of the canonical figures of analytic philosophy. And it is primarily about ethics. And, as we’ll see, it is in large part about the uselessness of analysis in ethics.\nPrincipia Ethica isn’t really why Moore is part of the analytic canon as such. He’s there for two or three other things. One is his series of attacks on idealism; that’s clearly central to the canon. Another is his defence of “common sense”, and, relatedly, his (in)famously straightforward rejection of scepticism. The defence of common sense is related to the rejection of idealism. One of the most prominent uses of common sense is Moore’s argument that McTaggert’s idealist theory of time implies that it is false that Moore had breakfast that day before he had lunch. And Moore argues it is much more plausible that he had breakfast before he had lunch than it is that the premises of McTaggert’s arguments are correct. (In fact he identifies the particular premise that he is sure is less plausible than the breakfast claim.) The third reason Moore is part of the analytic canon is that the term ‘analysis’, in this context, is one he popularised.\nBut none of this is ethics. Principia Ethica is a widely read book in contemporary philosophy, even if it isn’t always taken to be part of the analytic canon. But it’s not read for it’s ethics strictly speaking. Rather, it’s read for its meta-ethics. The ethics/meta-ethics distinction is blurry, but roughly meta-ethics is about the metaphysics of ethics (what is it for a moral claim to be true, if it is true), and about the theory of mind/language that is appropriate for ethics (what is it to accept/endorse a moral claim). The second most discussed feature of Principia Ethica these days is Moore’s conclusion, that moral thought and talk concerns a distinctive non-natural realm; moral properties really exist, and they are not identical to any natural property, and they are simple and unanalysable. The most discussed feature of Principia Ethica is Moore’s argument for that conclusion, because even people who don’t accept (or frankly understand) what Moore’s conclusion is, find his argument for that conclusion important. Indeed, if we were doing the history of this department we’d spend a lot of time on that argument. But we’re not, because (at last) we can get to what moved Keynes.\nThe book ends with two chapters which heavily influenced Keynes, in opposite directions. The chapter on the Ideal I can’t possibly describe better than Keynes does. I’ll just note three things about the principle of organic unities. One is that it’s basically what we’d now call value holism. The second, related point, is that it means that value is really not analysable. You don’t understand the value of the whole by understanding the value of the parts. The third is that I don’t really see what’s valuable in the idea of an organic unity that isn’t already implicit in the Walras/Jevons/Marshall marginalist theory of value. It seems to me implicit in marginalism that the fundamental bearers of value are whole states of affairs - indeed temporally extended states of affairs as Keynes notes when he presses for an intertemporal principle of organic unity.\nThe chapter on Ethics in Relation to Conduct in some ways influenced Keynes even more. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that he wrote the Treatise on Probability as a reaction/response to it. Moore held the following views, many of which Keynes would agree with.\n\nEthics is fundamentally about producing good states of affairs. In this respect he agrees with the 19th century consequentialists, Bentham, the Mills, Sidgwick, etc, though of course they did not think love and beauty were the main goods in the world.\nSince we can’t know what actions will actually produce goods, we should instead follow rules that will produce the most good over time.\nBut the world is too complicated, we can’t even work out for ourselves which rules those are.\nSo we should fall back on conventional morality.\n\nIn “My Early Beliefs”, Keynes says that they rejected step 1 of this. This is something that Woolf in particular objected to in Keynes’s story. And honestly it’s a little hard to believe that Keynes did not actually believe that producing good states of affairs (or at least good-sub-Moore states of affairs) was actually good. And Keynes bought step 2, and step 3. What he objected to was step 4. It would have somewhat crimped his lifestyle if he’d accepted it. (Just how promiscuous Keynes was when he was younger is a matter of some scholarly dispute, but a reasonable answer is very.) And he developed an entire theory of probability to say why 4 didn’t follow from 3."

    "text": "The Analytic Method\nBut none of this is telling us what is distinctively analytic about Moore, or about Keynes’s group. And here it helps I think to stop thinking about what these philosophers said, and instead think about how they said it. If we try to identify analytic philosophy with a thesis, or set of theses, it becomes incredibly hard to say what analytic philosophy is. There aren’t many theses that the analytic philosophers agreed on, and for those they did, there are plenty of people who preceded them who agreed with them too. But if you identify it with a way of doing philosophy, it is easier to see some distinctive trends.\nLook at all the things Keynes describes as being part of their approach circa 1903.\n\nThe reliance on intuitions as a key source of evidence.\nRelatedly, the reliance on authority and/or manifest incredulity (what became “the blank stare”) as a counter.\nThe obsession with precision; “If it appeared under cross-examination that you did not mean exactly anything, you lay under a strong suspicion of meaning nothing whatever.”\nThe conversion of big picture questions (e.g., is love a central part of value in the universe) to really detailed, almost esoteric ones (e.g., if A loves B, but only because they have attributed some of C’s attributes to B, is that better or worse than if they’d made up these attributes from whole cloth).\n\nThe long paragraph consisting mostly of questions they were asking themselves at the time is a fascinating Rorschach test. As I was reading through the list I went from thinking, “That’s a funny parody of the kind of things we’d talk about in common rooms” to “That’s actually an interesting question” to “That’s one of the biggest philosophical questions there is and something I’ve spent years thinking about”. And by the time I got to the third I started to wonder how much of a parody the earlier questions really were.\nAt a bigger picture, over this whole section of the paper I was having two thoughts that Keynes might have described as ludicrously incompatible. The first was that these were our people, this was how we do philosophy, that (to use some outdated internet lingo) I could point to these passages and say “One of us! One of us!”. The other was that this didn’t sound so different from how philosophers from elsewhere would unfairly parody the hyper-analytic departments of recent times, like ANU or MIT. Maybe those parodies weren’t so unfair after all.\nIt’s not that this kind of approach to philosophy was invented for the first time in history by G. E. Moore circa 1898. It doesn’t sound that different to Socrates, or at least (as Keynes alludes to) to the Socrates of the Dialogues. I bet some medieval thinkers resembled this too, especially Abelard, though maybe also some who weren’t subject to quite so much violence. But I do think there’s a style here, something that was new and which has persisted, more at some places, less at others, through the present."

    "section": "Content",
    "text": "Content\nAt risk of spoiling the fun of thinking about the themes and style of the paper, I want to turn to a question about content. Keynes thinks that they were led seriously astray by a philosophical mistake they made. But I’m not sure what exactly the mistake was, and there are two interestingly different choices.\nFirst, a note on the ‘they’. The memoir starts with a story of Keynes and Russell having a disastrous meeting with the novelist D. H. Lawrence. Keynes fusses a little over the date, insisting it was 1914 not 1915. (A detail he’d be unlikely to get wrong; his life was very different between those two years.) But then the bulk of the paper swings back to discussing events a decade earlier, around the time of the release of Principia Ethica. So which time is he talking about, or does he think the two are all part of a single thread.\nIn his autobiography, Leonard Woolf spends a long time responding to Keynes’s memoir, which clearly annoyed him no end. Woolf idolised Moore; he describes Moore as the only “great man” he ever met. And I think he thought the memoir was unfair to Moore. This seems like a simple misreading; Keynes is pointing out that Moore did have a chapter on how being good and doing good related, and they all ignored it. Woolf also, hilariously, responds to Keynes’s claim that while they all treated this philosophy like a science, it was really a kind of religion, by insisting that no it really was a science. But there’s one point he makes that I thought might be historically interesting. He conceded that by 1914 (though certainly not 1915) the self-absorption that Keynes describes was a characteristic of their group. He just insists that nothing of the sort was true in 1903, and Woolf attributes some of this change to them all moving to London. I think Keynes’s picture is that the way they all were in 1914 was baked in by their upbringing a decade earlier, but one could disagree here.\nAnyway, I thought that the memoir was attributing to Keynes and his friends two related but distinct theories, which I’ll call methodological individualism, and epistemological individualism.\nThe first is the theory that the right way to understand social facts is by starting with individuals, and regarding everything else as reducible to, and understandable in terms of, individual thoughts and deeds. So think of standard game theory, with everyone looking out for themselves and maximising a value function, as a paradigm of this kind of theory. And Marxist theories, with the social class as being more fundamental than the individuals who make it up, as a paradigm of the opposing view.\nThe second, epistemological individualism, is the thought that each person should decide for themselves what they think the right moral/social/political theory is, and the fact that others have come to different views, or that different views have become embedded in society, is of no epistemological significance. This is a kind of anti-conservative view; everything is constantly up for grabs.\nNow I think it’s the latter that Keynes really thinks was wrong looking back on their earlier lives. That’s why they risk upsetting the thin crust that humanity resides on. But sometimes it looks like he is also rejecting the former, which would be very significant for thinking about economic theorising. As you may know, one of the big debates in mid-to-late 20th century economics was whether an individualistic foundation could be given to broadly Keynesian theories. Is he saying here that he didn’t care if they could? We might come back to this when we get to the economics.\nAs well as these procedural points, Keynes also thinks that he and his younger friends were making a substantive error. They were underestimating the fact of, and importance of, irrationality in human conduct. So they were dismissing the importance of things, either things like emotions at the individual level, or structures and the social level, which arise in response to this kind of irrationality.\nHopefully the importance of all of this to the present day should be clear. We, as a discipline, tend to look favourably on methodological individualism, epistemological individualism, and on explanations which downplay irrationality. Are we making the same mistakes as Keynes’s younger self, and are we subject to the same (somewhat, but only somewhat, unfair) criticism that Lawrence launched at them?\nThere is one interesting connection to 21st century economic work here. One of the fairly resilient experimental findings in recent years is that people are bad at a certain kind of inference. The inference goes: This person is doing X, which doesn’t make sense to me. So this person has some evidence that I don’t have. And that evidence is relevant to what I should do. So I should adjust my behaviour accordingly. The inability to (reliably) make this inference is, according to some plausible-looking theories, part of the explanation for various inefficient (i.e., money-losing) behaviors in auction experiments, and possibly in real-world auctions.\nNow the inference the contemporary experimental economists are interested in is one where the observed behaviour of X makes sense given the evidence, and the person doing X knows this. Keynes, I think, is interested in real-life cases where doing X does make sense, but possibly the person doing doesn’t quite understand why. The thing about the wisdom of ancients is that the ancients weren’t in fact that wise. But they stumbled on to various practices that worked, and worked because of deep facts about human nature. Even if we can’t see the value in them, even if they couldn’t see the value in them, we should start with a presupposition that the practice has some value, and serves some purpose. Maybe we’ll figure out that the practice was a very roundabout way of reaching some actually desirable end, and we can do better at bringing about that end some other way. But simply saying that in a perfectly rational society we wouldn’t have that practice, that’s not much reason to abolish it.\nOK, last thing about this memoir, and it’s a question I don’t have a good answer to. Who are the Benthamites? They are clearly the villains of the piece. But look how many different groups they are connected to. At one point Keynes groups together the Bethamites and the purveyors of conventional morality. At another he says that they are the intellectual inspiration for Marxism. (I think in context this means Bolshevik Marxism, but I could be wrong about that.) And at yet another they are described as only interested in economic criteria. No one can really meet all those descriptions can they? Is Keynes just using it as a general term of disapprobation, like the way ‘neo-liberal’ is often used? I really don’t know."

    "section": "Background: The Malthusian Trap",
    "text": "Background: The Malthusian Trap\nFor most of human history, premise 1 was simply true. There was a sharp cap on the population in most places given by how much food could be produced. If there were a few good years, and more people didn’t starve to death, this was eventually a disaster because when things returned to normal, people did starve to death. The land had to be worked as hard as it could, by any hands that were available to work it, or the result would be famine.\nNow there are some caveats to this. It didn’t mean that everyone worked 90 hour weeks from the time they could work until death. The cycle of growing and harvesting crops means that there are times when there isn’t actually much to do. Pre-industrial folks definitely worked hard, especially at harvest time, but it wasn’t all work all the time. They were always running up against economic constraints, and if things went wrong they would starve, but providing more labour didn’t always solve the “economic problem”. So while they worked a lot, they could have worked more. And, in the early industrial era, when work was not tied to agricultural cycles, they did.\nThere were occasional spots in human history where we weren’t, collectively, running up against the limits of food production. Maybe the Roman Empire got there, especially when the Carthage-Rome trade system was at its peak. Certainly Europe got there in the immediate aftermath of the Black Death, when evidence suggests that wages, and maybe health, were as high as they’d be for centuries either side. Losing half the population to disease does actually stave off famine for quite a while. And as the centuries rolled on through the Renaissance, we saw more wealth created in the form of extra luxuries for the very rich, and occasionally in better infrastructure, especially roads and ports. We’ll come back to the wealth of the wealthy in a bit. But still, through much of human history, most people were getting just enough to survive.\nRecent historical work suggests this period went on much longer than we’d traditionally thought, and possibly longer than Keynes thought. I’m relying here on Brad DeLong’s recent book Slouching Towards Utopia, which I think is reliable, but could be wrong. Anyway, he suggests that as late as 1870, working class living standards (at least in north-western Europe and its outposts) were not appreciably better than they’d been in pre-industrial times. (I’ll borrow his phrase “Dover-Circle-Plus” to mean places within about 150 miles of the port of Dover, and their settlements, including the US and Australia, throughout the world.) This is quite amazing if true. The industrial revolution had been going for centuries by this point. The wealthy were getting astronomically rich, though things would improve yet more for them as the Gilded Age kicked in. And, and I think this is what threw academic observers at the time, by the mid-19th century, Britain had a real middle-class, who were much better off than all but the wealthiest people of the 18th century and earlier. But, according to DeLong and other recent historians, these gains only seeped down to the working classes starting around 1870. Now maybe that’s not too surprising if you’ve read Dickens, but I think it’s different to the standard story which says that the Dover-Circle-Plus as a whole started getting richer in the 18th century, and not just its wealthiest members.\nI’m bringing all this up because I suspect Keynes, for all his brilliance as an economic historian, didn’t fully appreciate how distinctive his own time was. I think he was led by some fallacies of aggregation to see the progression from the factories of the mid-18th century to the world of the summer of 1914 as a steady rise in standards of living. And that meant he thought he had a large inductive base for which to infer how things would go once the troubles started in August 1914 had sorted themselves out. But if what was really true was that we had an incredible jump from 1870 to 1914, something unlike anything the world had seen before, it would be reasonable to worry that the mistakes of August 1914 didn’t just interrupt this jump, but destroyed for good something rare and valuable.\nMy own (not particularly well informed) take is that something like the latter is actually true. The world of 1870-1914 was a distinctive thing, and incredibly valuable, at least for the people living in the Dover-Circle-Plus. Once it was destroyed that August, it never came back. What we had from 1946-1973 was a rather different, but also incredibly valuable, system, which was lost somewhere between the Vietnam War and the oil crises. And then, especially in East Asia, we’ve had some different again booms, which perhaps one or other of these Dover-Circle-Plus booms. But these are all not normal; normal is much slower steadier growth, which might not trickle down to the working classes at all. This is a very pessimistic take though, let’s return to Keynesian optimism."

    "section": "Work as a Psychological Need",
    "text": "Work as a Psychological Need\nKeynes has what might look like a very strange reason for rejecting the argument. He thought that work filled a psychological need for people as well as an economic need. In Moorean terms, work has an intrinsic as well as an instrumental value. And his response to that was to say that we’d probably move to a world where many people worked 15 hours a week, which would be enough to fulfil the sense of purpose, but not divert them from living good lives.\nActually, it’s not entirely clear whether he thinks this is a long run solution. It’s possible he thinks the psychological need for work is a legacy of being brought up in a certain kind of world, where fair is foul and foul is fair. It’s possible his deep view is that if we hadn’t been brought up in a world where work was valourised because it is necessary, we’d be happy to work even less.\nSo this raises all sorts of interesting questions about value, and is in some ways the most philosophical part of the whole thing. It relates, for instance, to the lecture Appiah did here I think last year on Work. And it relates to the Moorean theory of value that was a focus of the first half today.\nWould a human life that consisted entirely in non-work, consisted entirely in the things that Moore said were valuable like loving relationships and the appreciation of beauty, be missing something that work provided?\nAnd I think at some level Keynes really thinks the answer is no. And intuitively I think that too. But that’s funny coming from both of us because if we had more leisure time, we’d spend them on things that others would regard as work. I’d probably be reading philosophy, and maybe even scribbling out things like blog posts, without getting paid for it. Keynes used the little spare time he had in the 1930s to literally build a theatre in Cambridge; it opened just after the General Theory was published. It’s not exactly a life of relaxation.\nBut even people who do things work-like in their spare time don’t mimic work. They don’t grade papers, or process email, for fun. People who repair cars for fun don’t want to deal with the kind of repetitive work involved in fixing random strangers’ cars, like a paid mechanic has to do. I think that people, even people who have hobbies that overlap with what others do for paid employment, can get by fine without paid work. But maybe that’s a shallow take on human nature, and I’d be interested to know what others think."

    "text": "Coordination Problems\nThe 40-ish hour work week has proven remarkably sticky over the last 100 years. Some places, especially in western Europe, have pushed towards slightly shorter days. The pandemic led some places to move towards 4 day work weeks. But if it took a literal pandemic to get that amount of movement in the work week, I don’t see the path from here to 15 hour weeks.\nThe problem is that there are reasons for having most everyone working at the same time. There are aggregation effects from having coordinated business hours. Unilateral reductions in the work week are complicated because of these benefits.\nStill, if that was the only thing wrong with Keynes’s argument, there would be an easy solution. If we all wanted to use a doubling in productivity to halve our work commitments, we could all retire earlier, and have work lives that were half as long.\nAnd actually that sort of is what happened during the Trente Glorieuses after World War II. The retirement age fell to early 60s, even though life expectancy was rising. We did take extra leisure time, just in longer retirements, not shorter work weeks.\nGiven the coordination problem involved in running a modern economy, that seems like a sensible idea. And it suggests an alternative prediction to Keynes’s 15 hour week, one that agrees with the spirit but disagrees with the letter. Retirement ages would keep on falling, into the 50s, and maybe into the 40s.\nObviously that has not happened. Indeed, as you’ll have seen from the protests in France, retirement ages are rising there. The same is happening in Australia, where the previous gendered retirement age (65 for men, 60 for women) is in the process of moving to 67 for everyone. If early retirement was the Economic Possibility for our Grandchildren, it is moving further and further away."

    "section": "Industry and Service",
    "text": "Industry and Service\nKeynes’s essay is afflicted by a focus on a relatively narrow section of the society/economy: namely men who work in industrial jobs. By this I mean to include not just factory workers, but also miners, agricultural workers, and others who work with heavy machinery. In those industries, efficiency gains from the use of machinery were incredible, and while they have slowed, they have increased. But while that was a significant slice of the economy in Keynes’s time, especially of the male part of the economy, it isn’t everyone.\nThe economic possibilities our grand-daughters may have been looking forward to was a freedom from the drudgery of domestic work. We can helpfully divide that into two parts: caring for houses and caring for children.\nYou might think caring for houses is also something where the incredible advances in machinery help; dishwashers and washing machines and electric vacuums are much better than what came before them. But there’s a catch. As best I can tell, the effect of these inventions was to increase the expectations of cleanliness. (I can look up the references for this if you’re interested; I don’t have them to hand.) I gather that modern historians do not think that washing machines decreased the amount of time women spent on washing work in the home; the productivity gains were entirely captured by increased expectations of cleanliness. That is, if it got 4 times easier to wash a shirt, the expectation was that it would be washed 4 times as often. Maybe there’s a limit here - you can’t wash a business shirt more than once a day - and maybe we’re starting to see some gains. And there are some weak hints that the gender balance of this work is ever so slowly starting to change. But productivity gains didn’t lead to more leisure here.\nCaring for children is a different matter. On the one hand, the child care industry is much more developed than it was a century ago. But there are two big ‘on the other hands’. First, that industry mostly serves women in the workforce. Perhaps it need not, and the in Keynesian utopia women (or men who did their fair share of child rearing!) could use child care as a way of increasing leisure. Second, there really are limits on how much efficiency there is to wring out of the system. It’s really hard with anything like modern technology to do better than four infants to one child-minder. Maybe some kind of AI miracle will help with this, but I don’t see it happening any time soon. We have hit a pretty hard limit to productivity here.\nAnd that’s true in service industries in general. Haircuts have gotten somewhat more efficienct; it’s a lot easier to clean the equipment now than it was a hundred years ago. But really we’re tinkering around the edges here. The efficiency gains in the hair-cutting industry have been literally marginal for centuries. It’s a little easier to clean hotel rooms than it was a century ago, but not really much easier than it was 50 years ago. The big efficiency gain there was the pandemic move to not cleaning the rooms.\nThere’s a familiar story here. As the production of goods gets more and more efficient, more and more of the labour force moves into the production of services. But the production of services does not have the productivity growth of the production of goods. So the economy as a whole (by a kind of Simpson’s Paradox effect) stops growing as rapidly."

    "section": "Distribution",
    "text": "Distribution\nAll that said, it’s time to look at some actual numbers. It’s hard to get data going back to 1930, especially for some of the stats I’m going to care about. But we can get 50 years of US data, going back to 1974. If Keynes was right and the economy would grow by a factor of 8 over 100 years, and we all got 8 times richer over 100 years, that should mean it grows by nearly 3 times over 50 years. (We’re looking for square root of 8 growth here.)\nLet’s start with real GDP. We don’t care about ‘growth’ that’s just inflation, so everything here will be in real terms. (There are very big philosophical questions about just what it means to put things in real terms, and if people are interested we can do a week or two on that at the end of the semester. But not now.) Here is US GDP from 1974 onwards, setting the value in 1974 to 100.\n\n\n\n\nReal GDP of the US, 1974-present\n\n\n\nThat looks pretty good. We’re as a whole 3.6 times richer than 50 years ago, well over the 2.8 that we need for a factor of 8 growth per century. But hang on, the US also has many more people than 50 years ago, and just having more of us doesn’t make us wealthier. Let’s put that in per capita terms to see how much there is to go around.\n\n\n\n\nReal GDP per capita of the US, 1974-present\n\n\n\nWe’re already under the pace needed for factor of 8 growth per century. But still, growing by a factor of 2.3 per 50 years would be factor of 5 per century growth. Not Keynes’s 8, but enough to get to his 15 hour week.\nBut who gets that wealth? Remember what happened before 1870; Britain got much richer, but most British people did not. A quick first check is to see how much of that money is going to labour. So here is a measure of average real wages over time.\n\n\n\n\nReal mean personal/family income in the US, 1974-present\n\n\n\nI’ve done two graphs there, one for average family income, the other for average personal income. The family income has risen a little faster than the personal income, which actually kind of surprises me; I thought households were getting smaller, so the move would be in the other direction. But the difference between them isn’t huge. What is huge is the difference from the previous graph. The percentage rise is only half of what we saw on the previous graph. A huge proportion of the gains from increased productivity have gone to owners of capital, and more people other than labour. Since most people get most of their income from labour, that’s already part of the story as to why we’re not all on holiday all the time.\nBut even that doesn’t tell us everything. If LeBron James gets $50 million per year (and is probably underpaid relative to what he brings to the company), that alone is a 50 cent or something a year increase in average household income. But most people do not see those extra 50 cents from LeBron, or any other high income earner. A better measure of how most people are doing is median income. That still leaves out a lot of people, but it’s a start. Here’s how it looks.\n\n\n\n\nReal median personal income in the US, 1974-present\n\n\n\nThe source I’m getting this from only does median family income back to 1984, but the shape of the graph is the same. And the rise, over a 50 year period, is 40%. It’s considerably under 1% a year. (Note 1% a year for 50 years is about a 65% rise, like we saw with the mean.) It’s hard to change your lifestyle over a less than 1% a year increase.\nIt might be hard to tell from this graph, but if you add the gains from the 1992-2000 boom, and the 2012-2020 recovery (it really didn’t feel like a boom at the time), you get more than the gains for the whole period. Outside of those two eight year periods, the median worker has perhaps gone slightly backwards during the last half-century.\nSo there’s a simple answer to the question. We all still work a lot because while America got a lot richer, most Americans did not get particularly richer."

    "text": "Consumption\nStill, 40% isn’t nothing. Where did that 40% go? We don’t even work 40% less than a half-century ago. Or, at least, we didn’t before the pandemic; maybe the pandemic has changed things. Still, where did that 40% go?\nThat’s an easy one. It went on consumption. Comparing the median workers in 2020 and 1974, the 2020 version has:\n\nA bigger house\nA much bigger car\nVacations to further away places\nMore and bigger electronics\nBetter health care, especially in old age\n\nIf it was just the first two, the following somewhat unfair characterisation of the US worker would be true: they’d rather work more hours than drive a smaller car to work, or come home to a smaller house. And then we’d have the answer to Keynes; he just didn’t realise that people had those preferences. Or, he did and he disapproved. Come back to that thought in a bit.\nBecause the last three do complicate the story somewhat. For somewhat sensible reasons to do with coordination, to the extent that we’ve taken increased leisure time, we’ve taken it in old age. And to have pleasant Moorean states of mind in old age, it helps to have pharmaceutical assistance. (I guess some people think that helps at any age, but I couldn’t possibly comment.) The bigger electronics can be used for all sorts of things, but two of the things they are in fact used for are building better personal relationships - long-distance communication is the first thing people are looking for when they get electronics - and appreciation of beauty, or something beauty-like. (Does watching Leo Messi or Sam Kerr play football involve appreciation of beauty? Eh, maybe. Leave that one for the aestheticians.)\nOne final thought to leave on. Keynes, I think, was worried that the productivity gains would be sucked up by positional goods. Keynes was very much not a preference satisfaction theorist of welfare. If someone wants a bigger house solely because it is very important to them that they have a bigger house than their neighbour, that’s not a way in which satisfying their preferences increases their welfare. And even if one is a preference satisfaction theorist, if people have preferences for positional goods, the in the aggregate extra productivity is not going to help, because some people will disprefer the increase wealth of their neighbours. Is that’s what is going on with the American obsession with the size of cars and houses? That strikes me as a good and important question, and not one that we can answer from the armchair. But it might be the final piece of the puzzle. We don’t work less because (a) we’re not getting paid that much more, and (b) we have positional desires that will go unsatisfied if we work less. That’s a depressing note to end on, and I hope that others in the class have more optimistic takes on Keynes’s economic possibilities."

    "text": "Introductory Note\nBy David Garnett11 This paper is not so readily available online, so I’ve included it here, along with David Garnett’s introductory note.\nThe paper which follows was written as the result of a memoir of mine which was read in Lord Keynes’s absence, owing, I think, to his illness. It was afterwards sent to him to read. I am not sure of the date when my paper was read, but the envelope in which it is contained shows that it was returned by him from Tilton at the end of August 1938. His paper, which is printed here, was written at the beginning of September, when my paper was fresh in his mind. The subject of my memoir was the story of my introducing several of my friends to D. H. Lawrence, his intense dislike of them, and my bitter disappointment, which led me to stop seeing Lawrence. Keynes was one of my friends whom Lawrence most disliked. His feeling about them was, in essence, religious intolerance. He was a prophet who hated all those whose creeds protected them from ever becoming his disciples. I brought this out in my memoir and thus led Keynes to the re­ examination of his early beliefs which follows.\nI had got to know Lawrence and Frieda in 1912 owing to my father’s friendship with him.\nI was extremely fond of him and have no doubt that he liked me. I have never met a writer who appeared to have such genius. I greatly admired, and still admire, his short stories, his poems and several of his novels, particularly his first novel The White Peacock. But I was a rationalist and a scientist, and I was repelled by his intuitive and dogmatic philosophy, whereas the ideas of my friends from Cambridge interested and attracted me.\nIt was thus inevitable that sooner or later Lawrence should spew me out of his mouth, since I could never take his philo­sophy seriously. The breach was merely hastened by his meeting my friends. After my last visit to stay with Lawrence he wrote to Lady Ottoline Morrell, to whom I had also introduced him, in a letter included in his published correspondence:\n\nWe had David Garnett and Francis Birrell here for the week-end. When Bir­rell comes, tired and a bit lost and wandering-I love him. But, my God, to hear him talk sends me mad. To hear these young people talk really fills me with black fury: they talk endlessly, but endlessly-and never, never a good thing said. They are cased each in a hard little shell of his own and out of this they talk words. There is never for one second any outgoing of feeling and no reverence, not a crumb or grain of reverence. I cannot stand it. I will not have people like this-I had rather be alone. They made me dream of a beetle that bites like a scorpion. But I killed it-a very large beetle. I scotched it and it ran off-but I came on it again, and killed it. It is this horror of little swarming selves I can’t stand.\n\nOn the same day, the 19 April 1915, Lawrence wrote to me:\n\nMy dear David,\nNever bring Birrell to see me any more. There is something nasty about him like black beetles. He is horrible and unclean. I feel I should go mad when I think of your set, Duncan Grant and Keynes and Birrell. It makes me dream of beetles. In Cambridge I had a similar dream. I had felt it slightly before in the Stracheys. But it came full upon me in Keynes and in Duncan Grant. And yesterday I knew it again in Birrell ... you must leave these friends, these beetles, Birrell and Duncan Grant are done for forever. Keynes I am not sure ... when I saw Keynes that morning in Cambridge it was one of the crises of my life. It sent me mad with misery and hostility and rage ...\n\nI replied to this letter, which was really an ultimatum telling me to break with him or with my friends, as I thought suitably and I only once saw Lawrence again, by accident, on Armistice Night, the 11 November 1918, in Montague Shearman’s rooms in the Adelphi. The breach would no doubt have been healed had Lawrence been more often in England. I continued to see Frieda when she visited England periodically, and in 1928 I wrote to Lawrence to tell him how much I admired Lady Chatterley’s Lover in a letter which pleased him, and he wrote me a warm and friendly letter in return.\nThe reader is now in possession of the facts which led Maynard Keynes to re-examine his beliefs and those of his closest friends when they were undergraduates at Cambridge.\n\n\nMy Early Beliefs\nI can visualise very clearly the scene of my meeting with D. H. Lawrence in 1914 (Bunny seems to suggest 1915, but my memory suggests that it may have been earlier than that) of which he speaks in the letter from which Bunny quoted at the last meeting of the Club. But unfortunately I cannot remember any fragment of what was said, though I retain some faint remains of what was felt.\nIt was at a breakfast party given by Bertie Russell in his rooms in Nevile’s Court. There were only the three of us there. I fancy that Lawrence had been staying with Bertie and that there had been some meeting or party the night before, at which Law­rence had been facing Cambridge. Probably he had not enjoyed it.2 My memory is that he was morose from the outset and said very little, apart from indefinite expressions of irritable dissent, all the morning. Most of the talk was between Bertie and me, and I haven’t the faintest recollection of what it was about. But it was not the sort of conversation we should have had if we had been alone. It was at Lawrence and with the intention, largely unsuccessful, of getting him to participate. We sat round the fireplace with the sofa drawn across. Lawrence sat on the right-hand side in rather a crouching position with his head down. Bertie stood up by the fireplace, as I think I did, too, from time to time. I came away feeling that the party had been a failure and that we had failed to establish contact, but with no other particular impression. You know the sort of situation when two familiar friends talk at a visitor. I had never seen him before, and I never saw him again. Many years later he recorded in a letter, which is printed in his published correspon­dence, that I was the only member of Bloomsbury who had supported him by subscribing for Lady Chatterley.2 Professor G. E. Moore tells me that he sat next Lawrence in Hall that night and found nothing to say to him, but that afterwards Lawrence was introduced to Professor Hardy, the mathematician, with whom he had a long and friendly discussion. From the moment of Lawrence’s introduction to Hardy, the evening was a success. [D. G.]\nThat is all I remember. But Bunny’s story suggests some infer­ences to me. In the passage of his life which Bunny has described I think that Lawrence was influenced by two causes of emotional disturbance. One of them centred round Ottoline. As always, Ottoline was keeping more than one world. Except for Bertie, the Cambridge and Bloomsbury world was only just beginning to hold her. Lawrence, Gertler, Carrington were a different strand in her furbelows. Lawrence was jealous of the other lot; and Cambridge rationalism and cynicism, then at their height, were, of course, repulsive to him. Bertie gave him what must have been, I think, his first glimpse of Cambridge. It over­ whelmed, attracted and repulsed him-which was the other emotional disturbance. It was obviously a civilisation, and not less obviously uncomfortable and unattainable for him-very repulsive and very attractive. Now Bunny had come into his life quite independently, neither through Ottoline nor from Cam­bridge and Bloomsbury; he was evidently very fond of Bunny; and when he saw him being seduced by Cambridge, he was yet more jealous, just as he was jealous of Ottoline’s new leanings that way. And jealousy apart, it is impossible to imagine moods more antagonistic than those of Lawrence and of pre-war Cambridge.\nBut when all that has been said, was there something true and right in what Lawrence felt? There generally was. His reactions were incomplete and unfair, but they were not usually baseless. I have said that I have forgotten what the conversation was about. But I expect it was pretty brittle stuff-not so brittle as Frankie Birrell’s-but pretty brittle all the same. And although it was silly to take it, or to estimate it, at its face value, did the way of responding to life which lay behind it lack something important? Lawrence was oblivious of anything valuable it may have offered-it was a lack that he was violently apprehending. So Bunny’s memoir has thrown my mind back to reflections about our mental history in the dozen years before the war; and if it will not shock the club too much, I should like in this contribution to its proceedings to introduce for once, mental or spiritual, instead of sexual, adventures, to try and recall the principal impacts on one’s virgin mind and to wonder how it has all turned out, and whether one still holds by that youthful religion.\nI went up to Cambridge at Michaelmas 1902, and Moore’s Principia Ethica came out at the end of my first year. I have never heard of the present generation having read it. But, of course, its effect on us, and the talk which preceded and followed it, dominated, and perhaps still dominate, everything else. We were at an age when our beliefs influenced our behaviour, a characteristic of the young which it is easy for the middle-aged to forget, and the habits of feeling formed then still persist in a recognisable degree. It is those habits of feeling, influencing the majority of us, which make this Club a collectivity and separate us from the rest. They overlaid, somehow, our otherwise extremely different characters-Moore himself was a puritan and precisian, Strachey (for that was his name at that time) a Voltairean, Woolf a rabbi, myself a non-conformist, Sheppard a conformist and (as it now turns out) an ecclesiastic, Clive a gay and amiable dog, Sydney-Turner a quietist, Hawtrey a dogmatist and so on. Of those who had come just before, only MacCarthy and Ainsworth, who were much influenced by their personal feelings for Moore, came under his full influence. We did not see much of Forster at that time; who was already the elusive colt of a dark horse. It was only for us, those who were active in 1903, that Moore completely ousted McTaggart, Dickinson, Russell. The influence was not only overwhelming; but it was the extreme opposite of what Strachey used to call funeste; it was exciting, exhilarating, the beginning of a renaissance, the opening of a new heaven on a new earth, we were the forerunners of a new dispensation, we were not afraid of anything. Perhaps it was because we were so brought up that even at our gloomiest and worst we have never lost a certain resilience which the younger generation seem never to have had. They have enjoyed, at most, only a pale reflection of something, not altogether superseded, but faded and without illusions.\nNow what we got from Moore was by no means entirely what he offered us. He had one foot on the threshold of the new heaven, but the other foot in Sidgwick and the Benthamite calculus and the general rules of correct behaviour. There was one chapter in the Principia of which we took not the slightest notice. We accepted Moore’s religion, so to speak, and discarded his morals. Indeed, in our opinion, one of the greatest advantages of his religion, was that it made morals unnecessary-meaning by ‘religion’ one’s attitude towards oneself and the ultimate and by ‘morals’ one’s attitude towards the outside world and the intermediate. To the consequences of having a religion and no morals I return later.\nEven if the new members of the Club know what the religion was (do they?), it will not do any of us any harm to try and recall the crude outlines. Nothing mattered except states of mind, our own and other people’s of course, but chiefly our own. These states of mind were not associated with action or achievement or with consequences. They consisted in timeless, passionate states of contemplation and communion, largely unattached to ‘before’ and ‘after’. Their value depended, in accordance with the prin­ciple of organic unity, on the state of affairs as a whole which could not be usefully analysed into parts. For example, the value of the state of mind of being in love did not depend merely on the nature of one’s own emotions, but also on the worth of their object and on the reciprocity and nature of the object’s emotions; but it did not depend, if I remember rightly, or did not depend much, on what happened, or how one felt about it, a year later, though I myself was always an advocate of a principle of organic unity through time, which still seems to me only sensible. The appropriate subjects of passionate contemplation and communion were a beloved person, beauty and truth, and one’s prime objects in life were love, the creation and enjoyment of aesthetic ex­perience and the pursuit of knowledge. Of these love came a long way first. But in the early days under Moore’s influence the public treatment of this and its associated acts was, on the whole, austere and platonic. Some of us might argue that physical enjoyment could spoil and detract from the state of mind as a whole. I do not remember at what date Strachey issued his edict that certain Latin technical terms of sex were the correct words to use, that to avoid them was a grave error, and, even in mixed company, a weakness, and the use of other synonyms a vulgarity. But I should certainly say that this was later. In 1903 those words were not even esoteric terms of common discourse.\nOur religion closely followed the English puritan tradition of being chiefly concerned with the salvation of our own souls. The divine resided within a closed circle. There was not a very inti­mate connection between ‘being good’ and ‘doing good’; and we had a feeling that there was some risk that in practice the latter might interfere with the former. But religions proper, as distinct from modern ‘social service’ pseudo-religions, have al­ ways been of that character; and perhaps it was a sufficient offset that our religion was altogether unworldly-with wealth, power, popularity or success it had no concern whatever, they were thoroughly despised.\nHow did we know what states of mind were good? This was a matter of direct inspection, of direct unanalysable intuition about which it was useless and impossible to argue. In that case who was right when there was a difference of opinion? There were two possible explanations. It might be that the two parties were not really talking about the same thing, that they were not bring­ing their intuitions to bear on precisely the same object, and, by virtue of the principle of organic unity, a very small difference in the object might make a very big difference in the result. Or it might be that some people had an acuter sense of judgment, just as some people can judge a vintage port and others cannot. On the whole, so far as I remember, this explanation prevailed. In practice, victory was with those who could speak with the greatest appearance of clear, undoubting conviction and could best use the accents of infallibility. Moore at this time was a master of this method-greeting one’s remarks with a gasp of incredulity­ Do you really think that, an expression of face as if to hear such a thing said reduced him to a state of wonder verging on imbecility, with his mouth wide open and wagging his head in the negative so violently that his hair shook. Oh! he would say, goggling at you as if either you or he must be mad; and no reply was possible. Strachey’s methods were different: grim silence as if such a dreadful observation was beyond comment and the less said about it the better, but almost as effective for disposing of what he called death-packets. Woolf was fairly good at indicating a negative, but he was better at producing the effect that was use­ less to argue with him than at crushing you. Dickinson knew how to shrug his shoulders and retreat unconvinced, but it was retreat all the same. As for Sheppard and me we could only turn like worms, but worms who could be eventually goaded into voluble claims that worms have at least the right to turn. Yet after all the differences were about details. Broadly speaking we all knew for certain what were good states of mind and that they consisted in communion with objects of love, beauty and truth.\nI have called this faith a religion, and some sort of relation of neo-platonism it surely was. But we should have been very angry at the time with such a suggestion. We regarded all this as en­tirely rational and scientific in character. Like any other branch of science, it was nothing more than the application of logic and rational analysis to the material presented as sense-data. Our apprehension of good was exactly the same as our apprehension of green, and we purported to handle it with the same logical and analytical technique which was appropriate to the latter. Indeed we combined a dogmatic treatment as to the nature of experience with a method of handling it which was extravagantly scholastic. Russell’s Principles of Mathematics came out in the same year as Principia Ethica; and the former, in spirit, furnished a method for handling the material provided by the latter. Let me give you a few examples of the sort of things we used to discuss.\nIf A was in love with B and believed that B reciprocated his feelings, whereas in fact B did not, but was in love with C, the state of affairs was certainly not so good as it would have been if A had been right, but was it worse or better than it would become if A discovered his mistake? If A was in love with B under a misapprehension as to B’s qualities, was this better or worse than A’s not being in love at all? If A was in love with B because A’s spectacles were not strong enough to see B’s complexion, did this altogether, or partly, destroy the value of A’s state of mind? Suppose we were to live our lives backwards, having our experiences in the reverse order, would this affect the value of successive states of mind? If the states of mind enjoyed by each of us were pooled and then redistributed, would this affect their value? How did one compare the value of a good state of mind which had bad consequences with a bad state of mind which had good consequences? In valuing the consequences did one assess them at their actual value as it turned out eventually to be, or their probable value at the time? If at their probable value, how much evidence as to possible consequences was it one’s duty to collect before applying the calculus? Was there a separate objec­tive standard of beauty? Was a beautiful thing, that is to say, by definition that which it was good to contemplate? Or was there an actual objective quality ‘beauty’, just like ‘green’ and ‘good’? And knowledge, too, presented a problem. Were all truths equally good to pursue and contemplate?-as for example the number of grains in a given tract of sea-sand. We were disposed to re­pudiate very strongly the idea that useful knowledge could be preferable to useless knowledge. But we flirted with the idea that there might be some intrinsic quality-though not, perhaps, quite on a par with ‘green’ and ‘good’ and ‘beautiful’-which once could call ‘interesting’, and we were prepared to think it just possible that ‘interesting’ knowledge might be better to pursue than ‘uninteresting’  knowledge.  Another competing adjective was ‘important’, provided it was quite clear that ‘im­portant’ did not mean ‘useful’. Or to return again to our favourite subject, was a violent love affair which lasted a short time better than a more tepid one which endured longer? We were inclined to think it was. But I have said enough by now to make it clear that the problems of mensuration, in which we had involved ourselves, were somewhat formidable.\nIt was all under the influence of Moore’s method, according to which you could hope to make essentially vague notions clear by using precise language about them and asking exact questions. It was a method of discovery by the instrument of impeccable grammar and an unambiguous dictionary. ‘What exactly do you mean?’ was the phrase most frequently on our lips. If it appeared under cross-examination that you did not mean exactly anything, you lay under a strong suspicion of meaning nothing whatever. It was a stringent education in dialectic; but in practice it was a kind of combat in which strength of character was really much more valuable than subtlety of mind. In the preface to his great work, bespattered with the numerous italics through which the reader who knew him could actually hear, as with Queen Victoria, the vehemence of his utterance, Moore begins by saying that error is chiefly ‘the attempt to answer questions, without first discovering precisely what question it is which you desire to answer ... Once we recognise the exact meaning of the two questions, I think it also becomes plain exactly what kind of reasons are relevant as arguments for or against any particular answer to them.’ So we spent our time trying to discover precisely what questions we were asking, confident in the faith that, if only we could ask precise questions, everyone would know the answer. Indeed Moore expressly claimed as much. In his famous chapter on ‘The Ideal’ he wrote:\n\nIndeed, once the meaning of the question is clearly understood, the answer to it, in its main outlines, appears to be so obvious, that it runs the risk of seeming to be a platitude. By far the most valuable things, which we know or can imagine, are certain states of consciousness, which may be roughly described as the pleasures of human intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects. No one, probably, who has asked himself the question, has ever doubted that personal affection and the appreciation of what is beautiful in Art or Nature, are good in themselves; nor if we consider strictly what things are worth having purely for their own sakes, does it appear probable that any one will think that anything else has nearly so great a value as the things which are included under these two heads.\n\nAnd then there was the question of pleasure. As time wore on towards the nineteen-tens, I fancy we weakened a bit about plea­sure. But, in our prime, pleasure was nowhere. I would faintly urge that if two states of mind were similar in all other respects except that one was pleasurable and the other was painful there might be a little to be said for the former, but the principle of organic unities was against me. It was the general view (though not quite borne out by the Principia) that pleasure had nothing to do with the case and, on the whole, a pleasant state of mind lay under grave suspicion of lacking intensity and passion.\nIn those days X had not taken up women, nor Woolf monkeys, and they were not their present blithe selves. The two of them, sunk deep in silence and in basket chairs on opposite sides of the fireplace in a room which was at all times pitch dark, would stop sucking their pipes only to murmur that all good states of mind were extremely painful and to imply that all painful states of mind were extremely good. Strachey seconded them-it was only in his second childhood that Lytton took up pleasure­ though his sorrow was more fitful than their settled gloom. But with Sheppard and myself cheerfulness could not but break through, and we were in great disgrace about it. There was a terrible scene one evening when we turned insubordinate and reckless and maintained that there was nothing wrong in itself in being cheerful. It was decided that such low habits were parti­cularly characteristic of King’s as opposed to the austerity of Trinity.\nSocrates had persuaded Protarchus that pure hedonism was absurd. Moore himself was only prepared to accept pleasure as enhancement of a state of affairs otherwise good. But Moore hated evil and he found a place in his religion for vindictive punishment. ‘Not only is the pleasantness of a state not in pro­ portion to its intrinsic worth; it may even add positively to its vileness ... The infliction of pain on a person whose state of mind is bad may, if the pain be not too intense, create a state of things that is better on the whole than if the evil state of mind had existed unpunished. Whether such a state of affairs can ever constitute a positive good is another question.’ I call attention to the quali­fication ‘if the pain be not too intense’. Our Ideal was a merciful God.\nThus we were brought up-with Plato’s absorption in the good in itself, with a scholasticism which outdid St Thomas, in cal­vinistic withdrawal from the pleasures and successes of Vanity Fair, and oppressed with all the sorrows of Werther. It did not prevent us from laughing most of the time and we enjoyed supreme self-confidence, superiority and contempt towards all the rest of the unconverted world. But it was hardly a state of mind which a grown-up person in his senses could sustain literally. When MacCarthy came down for a week-end, he would smile affectionately, persuade Moore to sing his German Lieder at the piano, to hear which we all agreed was a very good state of mind indeed, or incite Bob Trevy to deliver a broken oration which was a frantic travesty of the whole method, the charm of it lying in the impossibility of deciding whether Bob himself meant it, half at least, seriously or not.\nIt seems to me looking back, that this religion of ours was a very good one to grow up under. It remains nearer the truth than any other that I know, with less irrelevant extraneous matter and nothing to be ashamed of; though it is a comfort to-day to be able to discard with a good conscience the calculus and the mensura­tion and the duty to know exactly what one means and feels. It was a purer, sweeter air by far than Freud cum Marx. It is still my religion under the surface. I read again last week Moore’s famous chapter on ‘The Ideal’. It is remarkable how wholly oblivious he managed to be of the qualities of the life of action and also of the pattern of life as a whole. He was existing in a timeless ecstasy. His way of translating his own particular emotions of the moment into the language of generalised abstraction is a charm­ing and beautiful comedy. Do you remember the passage in which he discusses whether, granting that it is mental qualities which one should chiefly love, it is important that the beloved person should also be good-looking? In the upshot good looks win a modest victory over ‘mental qualities’. I cannot forbear to quote this sweet and lovely passage, so sincere and passionate and careful:\n\nI think it may be admitted that wherever the affection is most valuable, the appreciation of mental qualities must form a large part of it, and that the presence of this part makes the whole far more valuable than it could have been without it. But it seems very doubtful whether this appreciation, by itself, can possess as much value as the whole in which it is combined with an appreciation of the appropriate corporeal expression of the mental qualities in question. It is certain that in all actual cases of valuable affection, the bodily expressions of character, whether by looks, by words, or by actions, do form a part of the object towards which the affection is felt, and that the fact of their inclusion appears to heighten the value of the whole state. It is, indeed, very difficult to imagine what the cognition of mental qualities alone, unaccompanied by any corporeal expression, would be like; and, in so far as we succeed in making this abstraction, the whole considered certainly appears to have less value. I therefore conclude that the importance of an admiration of admirable mental qualities lies chiefly in the immense superiority of a whole, in which it forms a part, to one in which it is absent, and not in any high degree of intrinsic value which it possesses by itself. It even appears to be doubtful whether, in itself, it possesses so much value as the appreciation of mere corporeal beauty undoubtedly does possess; that is to say, whether the appre­ciation of what has great intrinsic value is so valuable as the appreciation of what is merely beautiful.\nBut further if we consider the nature of admirable mental qualities, by themselves, it appears that a proper appreciation of them involves a reference to purely material beauty in yet another way. Admirable mental qualities do, if our previous conclusions are correct, consist very largely in an emotional contemplation of beautiful objects; and hence the appreciation of them will consist essentially in the contemplation of such contemplation. It is true that the most valuable appreciation of persons appears to be that which consists in the appreciation of their appreciation of other persons: but even here a reference to material beauty appears to be involved, both in respect of the fact that what is appreciated in the last instance may be the contemplation of what is merely beautiful, and in respect of the fact that the most valuable appreciation of a person appears to include an appreciation of his corporeal expression. Though, therefore, we may admit that the appreciation of a person’s attitude towards other persons, or, to take one instance, the love of love, is far the most valuable good we know, and far more valuable than the mere love of beauty, yet we can only admit this if the first be understood to include the latter, in various degrees of directness.\n\nThe New Testament is a handbook for politicians compared with the unworldliness of Moore’s chapter on ‘The Ideal’. I know no equal to it in literature since Plato. And it is better than Plato because it is quite free from fancy. It conveys the beauty of the literalness of Moore’s mind, the pure and passionate intensity of his vision, unfanciful and undressed-up. Moore had a night­mare once in which he could not distinguish propositions from tables. But even when he was awake, he could not distinguish love and beauty and truth from the furniture. They took on the same definition of outline, the same stable, solid, objective quali­ties and common-sense reality.\nI see no reason to shift from the fundamental intuitions of Principia Ethica; though they are much too few and too narrow to fit actual experience which provides a richer and more various content. That they furnish a justification of experience wholly independent of outside events had become an added comfort, even though one cannot live today secure in the undisturbed individualism which was the extraordinary achievement of the early Edwardian days, not for our little lot only, but for everyone else, too.\nI am still a long way off from D. H. Lawrence and what he might have been justified in meaning when he said that we were ‘done for’. And even now I am not quite ready to approach that theme. First of all I must explain the other facet of our faith. So far it has been a question of our attitude to ourselves and one another. What was our understanding of the outside world and our relation to it?\nIt was an important object of Moore’s book to distinguish between goodness as an attribute of states of mind and rightness as an attribute of actions. He also has a section on the justification of general rules of conduct. The large part played by considera­tions of probability in his theory of right conduct was, indeed, an important contributory cause to my spending all the leisure of many years on the study of that subject: I was writing under the joint influence of Moore’s Principia Ethica and Russell’s Principia Mathematica. But for the most part, as I have said, we did not pay attention to this aspect of the book or bother much about it. We were living in the specious present, nor had begun to play the game of consequences. We existed in the world of Plato’s Dialogues; we had not reached the Republic, let alone the Laws. This brought us one big advantage. As we had thrown hedon­ism out of the window and, discarding Moore’s so highly prob­lematical calculus, lived entirely in present experience, since social action as an end in itself and not merely as a lugubrious duty had dropped out of our Ideal, and not only social action, but the life of action generally, power, politics, success, wealth, ambition, with the economic motive and the economic criterion less prominent in our philosophy than with St Francis of Assisi, who at least made collections for the birds, it follows that we were amongst the first of our generation, perhaps alone amongst our generation, to escape from the Benthamite tradition. In practice, of course, at least so far as I was concerned, the outside world was not forgotten or forsworn. But I am recalling what our Ideal was in those early days when the life of passionate contem­plation and communion was supposed to oust all other purposes whatever. It can be no part of this memoir for me to try to explain why it was such a big advantage for us to have escaped from the Benthamite tradition. But I do now regard that as the worm which has been gnawing at the insides of modern civilisation and is responsible for its present moral decay. We used to regard the Christians as the enemy, because they appeared as the representa­tives of tradition, convention and hocus-pocus. In truth it was the Benthamite calculus, based on an over-valuation of the economic criterion, which was destroying the quality of the popular Ideal. Moreover, it was this escape from Bentham, joined with the unsurpassable individualism of our philosophy, which has served to protect the whole lot of us from the final reductio ad absurdum of Benthamism known as Marxism. We have completely failed, indeed, to provide a substitute for these economic bogus-faiths capable of protecting or satisfying our successors. But we our­ selves have remained-am I not right in saying all of us?­ altogether immune from the virus, as safe in the citadel of our ultimate faith as the Pope of Rome in his.\nThis is what we gained. But we set on one side, not only that part of Moore’s fifth chapter on ‘Ethics in relation to Conduct’ which dealt with the obligation so to act as to produce by causal connection the most probable maximum of eventual good through the whole procession of future ages (a discussion which was in­deed riddled with fallacies), but also the part which discussed the duty of the individual to obey general rules. We entirely repudi­ated a personal liability on us to obey general rules. We claimed the right to judge every individual case on its merits, and the wisdom, experience and self-control to do so successfully. This was a very important part of our faith, violently and aggressively held, and for the outer world it was our most obvious and danger­ous characteristic. We repudiated entirely customary morals, conventions and traditional wisdom. We were, that is to say, in the strict sense of the term, immoralists. The consequences of being found out had, of course, to be considered for what they were worth. But we recognised no moral obligation on us, no inner sanction, to conform or to obey. Before heaven we claimed to be our own judge in our own case. I have come to think that this is, perhaps, rather a Russian characteristic. It is certainly not an English one. It resulted in a general, widespread, though partly covert, suspicion affecting ourselves, our motives and our behaviour. This suspicion still persists to a certain extent, and it always will. It has deeply coloured the course of our lives in relation to the outside world. It is, I now think, a justifiable suspicion. Yet so far as I am concerned, it is too late to change. I remain, and always will remain, an immoralist.\nI am not now concerned, however, with the fact that this aspect of our code was shocking. It would have been not less so, even if we had been perfectly right. What matters a great deal more is the fact that it was flimsily based, as I now think, on an a priori view of what human nature is like, both other people’s and our own, which was disastrously mistaken.\nI have said that we were amongst the first to escape from Benthamism. But of another eighteenth-century heresy we were the unrepentant heirs and last upholders. We were among the last of the Utopians, or meliorists as they are sometimes called, who believe in a continuing moral progress by virtue of which the human race already consists of reliable, rational, decent people, influenced by truth and objective standards, who can be safely released from the outward restraints of convention and traditional standards and inflexible rules of conduct, and left, from now onwards, to their own sensible devices, pure motives and reliable intuitions of the good. The view that human nature is reasonable had in 1903 quite a long history behind it. It underlay the ethics of self-interest-rational self-interest as it was called­ just as much as the universal ethics of Kant or Bentham which aimed at the general good; and it was because self-interest was rational that the egoistic and altruistic systems were supposed to work out in practice to the same conclusions.\nIn short, we repudiated all versions of the doctrine of original sin, of there being insane and irrational springs of wickedness in most men. We were not aware that civilisation was a thin and pre­carious crust erected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained by rules and conventions skilfully put across and guilefully preserved. We had no respect for traditional wisdom or the restraints of custom. We lacked reverence, as Lawrence observed and as Ludwig with justice also used to say­ for everything and everyone. It did not occur to us to respect the extraordinary accomplishment of our predecessors in the ordering of life (as it now seems to me to have been) or the elaborate framework which they had devised to protect this order. Plato said in his Laws that one of the best of a set of good laws would be a law forbidding any young man to enquire which of them are right or wrong, though an old man remarking any defect in the laws might communicate this observation to a ruler or to an equal in years when no young man was present. That was a dictum in which we should have been unable to discover any point or significance whatever. As cause and consequence of our general state of mind we completely misunderstood human nature, including our own. The rationality which we attributed to it led to a superficiality, not only of judgment, but also of feeling. It was not only that intellectually we were pre-Freudian, but we had lost something which our predecessors had without replacing it. I still suffer incurably from attributing an unreal rationality to other people’s feelings and behaviour (and doubt­ less to my own, too). There is one small but extraordinarily silly manifestation of this absurd idea of what is ‘normal’, namely the impulse to protest-to write a letter to The Times, call a meeting in the Guildhall, subscribe to some fund when my presuppositions as to what is ‘normal’ are not fulfilled. I behave as if there really existed some authority or standard to which I can successfully appeal if I shout loud enough-perhaps it is some hereditary vestige of a belief in the efficacy of prayer.\nI have said that this pseudo-rational view of human nature led to a thinness, a superficiality, not only of judgment, but also of feeling. It seems to me that Moore’s chapter on ‘The Ideal’ left out altogether some whole categories of valuable emotion. The attribution of rationality to human nature, instead of enriching it, now seems to me to have impoverished it. It ignored certain powerful and valuable springs of feeling. Some of the spon­taneous, irrational outbursts of human nature can have a sort of value from which our schematism was cut off. Even some of the feelings associated with wickedness can have value. And in addition to the values arising out of spontaneous, volcanic and even wicked impulses, there are many objects of valuable con­templation and communion beyond those we knew of-those concerned with the order and pattern of life amongst communi­ties and the emotions which they can inspire. Though one must ever remember Paley’s dictum that ‘although we speak of com­munities as of sentient beings and ascribe to them happiness and misery, desires, interests and passions, nothing really exists or feels but individuals’, yet we carried the individualism of our individuals too far.\nAnd as the years wore on towards 1914, the thinness and super­ficiality, as well as the falsity, of our view of man’s heart became, as it now seems to me, more obvious; and there was, too, some falling away from the purity of the original doctrine. Concentration on moments of communion between a pair of lovers got thoroughly mixed up with the, once rejected, pleasure. The pat­tern of life would sometimes become no better than a succession of permutations of short sharp superficial ‘intrigues’, as we called them. Our comments on life and affairs were bright and amusing, but brittle-as I said of the conversation of Russell and myself with Lawrence-because there was no solid diagnosis of human nature underlying them. Bertie in particular sustained simultaneously a pair of opinions ludicrously incompatible. He held that in fact human affairs were carried on after a most irrational fashion, but that the remedy was quite simple and easy, since all we had to do was to carry them on rationally. A discussion of practical affairs on these lines was really very boring. And a discussion of the human heart which ignored so many of its deeper and blinder passions, both good and bad, was scarcely more interesting. Indeed it is only states of mind that matter, provided we agree to take account of the pattern of life through time and give up regarding it as a series of independent, instan­taneous flashes, but the ways in which states of mind can be valuable, and the objects of them, are more various, and also much richer, than we allowed for. I fancy we used in old days to get round the rich variety of experience by expanding illegiti­mately the field of aesthetic appreciation (we would deal, for example, with all branches of the tragic emotion under this head), classifying as aesthetic experience what is really human experience and somehow sterilising it by this mis-classification.\nIf, therefore, I altogether ignore our merits-our charm, our intelligence, our unworldliness, our affection-I can see us as water-spiders, gracefully skimming, as light and reasonable as air, the surface of the stream without any contact at all with the eddies and currents underneath. And if I imagine us as coming under the observation of Lawrence’s ignorant, jealous, irritable, hostile eyes, what a combination of qualities we offered to arouse his passionate distaste; this thin rationalism skipping on the crust of the lava, ignoring both the reality and the value of the vulgar passions, joined to libertinism and comprehensive irreverence, too clever by half for such an earthy character as Bunny, seducing with its intellectual chic such a portent as Ottoline, a regular skin-poison. All this was very unfair to poor, silly, well-meaning us. But that is why I say that there may have been just a grain of truth when Lawrence said in 1914 that we were ‘done for’."

The Theory of Probability is concerned with that part which we obtain by argument, and it treats of the different degrees in which the results so obtained are conclusive or inconclusive.\n\nLots going on here. First, what exactly is ‘direct’?\nI assume it includes observation, which as an early analytic Keynes means apprehension of sense-data. I mostly think that this is a detachable part of the theory, and if we replace it with a more plausible theory of perception everything goes through, but that might be questioned.\nSecond, why does probability go with all of argument? Does it include logic and math? Yes! Keynes thinks that deductive validity is a special case of probability. We’re going to come back to this point, a lot, because it is central to how Keynes understands probability.\nBut it’s a tricky point, because just what Keynes means by logic might not be exactly the same thing as we mean.\n\nBut many other arguments are rational and claim some weight without pretending to be certain. In Metaphysics, in Science, and in Conduct, most of the arguments, upon which we habitually base our rational beliefs, are admitted to be inconclusive in a greater or less degree.\n\nTwo things to note here.\nFirst, probability is about arguments. We’ll get much more on this to follow, but probability isn’t about propositions for Keynes. Just what the relationship between sentential probability and argument probability turns out to be is complicated, but arguments are central.\nSecond, what a striking view about Metaphysics and Conduct, i.e., ethics. We all presumably agree that probability is central to science. That it’s central to metaphysics and ethics is interesting.\nTo be sure, by “Metaphysics” here Keynes maybe means everything we’d include in LEMMing philosophy (Language, Epistemology, Mind, Metaphysics).1 And maybe it isn’t too surprising that mind, at least, is probabilistic. Also there has been a surge in interest in moral uncertainty recently. Keynes was, again, there first.1 Launching that acronym at the world is possibly my most significant philosophical legacy."

Among other things, he is here rejecting frequentism, as espoused by (e.g.,) his colleague Edgeworth.22 See his essay on Edgeworth in Essays in Biography for some of this disagreement, and Edgeworth’s paper “Philosophy of Chance” (Mind 1922) for Edgeworth’s side of this dispute, as well as the discussions of frequentism later in the Treatise.\nThe quote there makes this seem doubly modalised; it’s degrees of rational belief that knowledge authorises us to entertain. I think that’s just for emphasis. But one thing we’ll come back to is this word authorise. Keynes doesn’t say compel here. Jim Joyce’s version of what’s otherwise a similar view goes closer to compel.33 See, e.g., “A defense of imprecise credences in inference and decision making” (Philosophical Perspectives, 2010) for Joyce’s version of the view.\n\nwhile it is often convenient to speak of propositions as certain or probable, this expresses strictly a relationship in which they stand to a corpus of knowledge, actual or hypothetical, and not a characteristic of the propositions in themselves.\n\nAgain, sentences (or propositions) are not probable. It’s interesting that he says, and italicises, corpus here. We’ll come back to this below.\n\nWhen once the facts are given which determine our knowledge, what is probable or improbable in these circumstances has been fixed objectively, and is independent of our opinion.\n\nReal probability, the property of arguments, is not subjective. Something might be probable for you, and not for me, but only because you know more than me. The evidence-to-probability connection is objective and impersonal.\nI had written out something about how the use of knowledge here suggests Keynes is a proto-Williamsonian, believing a version of E=K4. But it’s clear in a couple of paragraphs that it is ‘direct knowledge’ that is the input, and this quote is sloppy; he should have said “determine our direct knowledge”.4 People usually cite Williamson’s 2000 book Knowledge and Its Limits for the statement of this, but in this context the most relevant citation is the earlier paper “Conditionalizing on knowledge” (British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, 1998)\n\nThe Theory of Probability is logical, therefore, because it is concerned with the degree of belief which it is rational to entertain in given conditions, and not merely with the actual beliefs of particular individuals, which may or may not be rational.\n\nTo modern eyes, this looks like a confusion. I think Keynes is assuming a lot of things here, and I’m not sure anyone circa 2023 would buy all of them.\n\nProbability is about rational (degree of) belief.\nWhat’s rational is an objective matter, and just dependent on the evidence one has.\nThe evidence, in this sense, is all and only what one knows.\nSomething that is objective in this sense is modally invariant.\nSomething that is modally invariant is part of logic.\n\nIt’s tempting to say that 5 is a mistake because it overlooks Kripkean points about the distinctness of the necessary/contingent distinction and the a priori/a posteriori distinction.5 But I don’t think that’s quite it. I think even once you make that distinction, Keynes would be on reasonably solid ground saying probability statements are both necessary and a priori.5 The literature on Kripke is infinite and growing, but it’s best to start with Kripke’s book Naming and Necessity, published in 1980 but a reprint of something published as a long paper in 1972.\nWhat’s really striking about 5 is that it overlooks, or dismisses, the Kantian view that statements like these are synthetic a priori.6 Or, though I think this is a less likely interpretation, it thinks that logical knowledge might be synthetic. The only mention of the word ‘synthetic’ comes in chapter 22.6 Also an infinite literature, but section 2 of the Stanford Encyclopedia article on Kant’s Theory of Judgment is a decent start.\nIt helps to think about something that Keynes mentions in the Preface here. There are two big philosophical influences on the Treatise. One of them, which we discussed last week, is Moore. And the other is Russell, and especially the Russell of Principia.7 (Keynes only occasionally seems to remember that Principia was co-authored.) So Keynes is a logicist about mathematics. Does that affect why he doesn’t consider the synthetic a priori option? Why doesn’t Moore’s influence affect him here? (Actually, what Moore thought about analyticity is a bit of a mess that we don’t want to get into.)7 I.e., Principia Mathematica, by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913. One key claim of the book was that mathematical truths, properly understood, are logical truths.\nAnyway, when Keynes says that probability is logical, he’s making a leap, and probably not one he’s entitled to, and probably one that gets him into trouble. But it’s related to why he thinks that deductive validity is really a special case of probability. We’ll come back to what kind of mess this is.\nTwo things about logic that I think will cause us some concern as we move along. Logic is formal; that is, it is to do with forms of sentences. Is probability formal in the same sense? Relatedly, logic is language-invariant. Change the language so that the basic terms are grue8 and bleen rather than green and blue, and none of the validities change. Is probability language-invariant in the same sense? If the answer to either question is no, how logical is the theory of probability.8 On grue, see Nelson Goodman’s 1953 book Fact, Fiction and Forecast."

(Footnote: This will be written a/h = \\(\\alpha\\).)\n\nSome of this sounds like familiar view. Probability is fundamentally conditional, like in Popper9, Hájek10, and others. It’s about rational belief, though here looking less Permissive than in earlier paragraphs, which is also familiar.9 See his Logic of Scientific Discovery, first published in 1933 but I believe not translated into English until 1959. The appendices are particularly important for this point.10 “What Conditional Probability Could Not Be” (Synthese 2003)\nBut there are three distinct things here.\nOne is that the right-hand side is set-valued. I don’t think that ends up making a huge difference; I think in every case you could use the conjunction of the members instead. But it’s distinctive.\nA second is that a is a set as well. This is very strange. I think in practice we mostly get examples where a is a singleton set. But if not, should we think of this set as standing for something more like the conjunction of the members, or the disjunction? Is this like multiple-conclusion logic?11 Did multiple-conclusion logic even exist at that time? I really don’t know what is happening there.11 For a good (if difficult) introduction, see Greg Restall’s paper “Multiple Conclusions”. It’s in an obscure edited volume, but the version on his website is good enough.\nThe third is \\(\\alpha\\). We will have much more to say about that presently."

We believe that there is some real objective relation between Darwin’s evidence and his conclusions, which is independent of the mere fact of our belief, and which is just as real and objective, though of a different degree, as that which would exist if the argument were as demonstrative as a syllogism. We are claiming, in fact, to cognise correctly a logical connection between one set of propositions which we call our evidence and which we suppose ourselves to know, and another set which we call our conclusions, and to which we attach more or less weight according to the grounds supplied by the first.\n\nTwo things about this passage. First, once again it is really hard to see where the logical comes from here, unless we’re just assuming away the possibility of a Kantian approach. Second, this sounds a lot like what Keynes says in his extremely brief remarks he makes memorialising Ramsey.12 I do think there’s textual evidence here that while Keynes thought Ramsey gives him a lot to think about and reply to, he does not think that Ramsey fatally undermines the whole theory.12 The note on Ramsey is reprinted in Essays in Biography."

If you’re interested in placing his view, it is a form of the rule-governed contextualism that Jason Stanley13 was the most prominent proponent of (though which I gather Jason has now abandoned). If we have a spare 10 hours or so I can rehash the debates of that decade, but probably (given my evidence) there are better things to do with our time.13 The paper usually most cited paper on this is his “Context and Logical Form” (Linguistics and Philosophy 2000), though it should be read alongside the co-authored paper with Zoltan Szabó “On Quantifier Domain Restriction” (Mind and Language 2000).\n\nIt would be as absurd to deny that an opinion was probable, when at a later stage certain objections have come to light, as to deny, when we have reached our destination, that it was ever three miles distant…\n\nOK, I can’t help one small note here. Keynes is here making the important point that even when new information comes to light, we don’t retract our previous probability claims.14 Those claims have been superseded, but we don’t treat them as being wrong. The statement was indeed probable. I think this sounds right. And, if we were doing a 2000s class, this would be perhaps the most important of the four most important things to check about a bit of context-sensitive language.1514 The relativist view that John MacFarlane defends in his 2014 book “Assessment Sensitivity: Relative Truth and its Applications” makes heavy use of data about retraction. That book was based on papers and manuscripts that had circulated for a decade by the time the book came out; so the 2014 date is a little misleading. Also I’m contractually obliged to note that MacFarlane is responsible for a key part of the best open source academic writing software available, and it’s the engine behind the software I’m using to write these notes.15 The others are disagreements involving the term, speech reports involving the term, and bound uses of the term."

If Gettier had paraphrased the views of Ayer and Chisholm as the “Rational True Belief” model of knowledge (in his “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?” (Analysis 1963)), the last 60 years of epistemology may have looked very different.\nBigger point: He doesn’t quite say this, but Keynes kind of implicates factualism about rational full belief. That is, he suggests that one cannot have rational full belief in a false proposition.\n\nThe highest degree of rational belief, which is termed certain rational belief, corresponds to knowledge. We may be said to know a thing when we have a certain rational belief in it, and vice versa.\n\nOn the face of it, this is not a good account of knowledge, and feels like scepticism."

At first it looks like Keynes is giving something like a JTB theory of knowledge, and there are Gettier counterexamples and we can treat this as an historical vestige.\nBut look more closely. I don’t think he’s saying that these are conjuncts. I don’t quite know what corresponds to means here, surely knowledge doesn’t equal truth. But it looks like he is saying that here are two things knowledge implies.\nRemember, there are Gettier cases (obviously not under that name) in Problems of Philosophy,17 which Keynes must have read. He knows that there are problems of defining knowledge this way.17 Bertrand Russell’s 1912 book advertising his new approach to philosophy to a more popular audience; Russell says a lot of things in that book, and many of them are very odd, but the standard view nowadays is on the whole closer to Russell’s views than the views of people he was attacking.\nIt looks to me like he’s adopting (without much, you know, argument) a kind of infallibilist theory of knowledge that we find in the present day in Williamson and his followers, and in earlier times in some Indian traditions. (Jennifer Nagel has written on the connection b/w these two schools.18)18 See her “Classical Indian Scepticism: Reforming or Rejecting Philosophy” (Comparative Philosophy 2019) as a starting point, and note the reference to Nilanjan Das’s Stanford Encyclopedia entry on Śrīharṣa.\n\nThus rational belief of whatever degree can only arise out of knowledge, although the knowledge may be of a proposition secondary, in the above sense, to the proposition in which the rational degree of belief is entertained.\n\nAt first I thought this was a slip, but Keynes really believes it. Rational belief requires knowledge of probability. I think that having evidence h, and the probability of a given h is x, is enough to warrant degree of belief x in a. Keynes thinks that I need something else, namely knowledge of the probability. By paragraph 7 Keynes indicates that this isn’t always explicit, so he is acknowledging the unintuitive nature of the view. But he clearly states the stronger view on several occasions as the chapter proceeds.\nIt’s perhaps interesting to talk about the comparison with some stuff Knight19 says around the same time about the sufficiency of acting as if one knew all these theoretical claims.19 In his book, also published in 1921, Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit."

    "text": "Imprecise Probabilities\nIt’s time to bring onto the table a model for Keynesian probabilities that some of you are probably familiar with. I assume everyone is familiar with the standard Bayesian model - every rational agent has in their head some particular real-valued probability function, and they update it by conditionalisation on new evidence, and their confidence in p is the probability of p on this function. So far, so good.\nThe imprecise probabilities model is that everyone has a set of probability functions in their head. The true probability claims that a person can make are all and only those where the set agrees. So if Pr(p) &gt; Pr(q) for every Pr in the set, they can say p is more probable than q. If Pr(p) &gt; 0.8 for every Pr in the set, they can say p is at least 80% probable. If Pr(p) = x for every Pr in the set, they can say the probability of p is x, and so on.\nOne very big question is how good a model this is of Keynes’s theory. One of my earliest papers24 was an argument that it’s a very good model, though in retrospect I fear I overstated the case a little.24 “Keynes, Uncertainty, and Interest Rates” (Cambridge Journal of Economics 2002).\nAnother question is whether it’s a good model full stop, and I guess that will be somewhere between the back and front of our minds the rest of the way.\nAnyway, one of the objections to this model is that it allows dilation.25 It’s possible that before getting some evidence, all the Pr agree on the probability of p, but after getting new evidence, the possible values of Pr(p) are all over the shop. For reasons I’ve never understood, a lot of philosophers think this is a very bad feature of the model.25 See section 3.1 of the Stanford Encyclopedia article on Imprecise Probabilities for more than you might want to know about dilation. I’m hardly a neutral party here, but I think what Keynes says about Gibbon basically settles the debate.\nAnyway, here’s Keynes from the end of paragraph 7 of chapter 3.2626 Also the footnote demolition of the law of succession at the start of the paragraph is great, and maybe relevant to some contemporary projects.\n\nIn some cases, moreover, where general statistics are available, the numerical probability which might be derived from them is inapplicable because of the presence of additional knowledge with regard to the particular case. Gibbon calculated his prospects of life from the volumes of vital statistics and the calculations of actuaries. But if a doctor had been called to his assistance the nice precision of these calculations would have become useless; Gibbon’s prospects would have been better or worse than before, but he would no longer have been able to calculate to within a day or week the period for which he then possessed an even chance of survival.\n\nI’d forgotten that passage when I wrote a similar (though less good!) example arguing that dilation is in fact what you want to have happen in some cases.27 The Gibbon case is a great example and more philosophers should read Keynes.27 In my example we know that our neighbour has gambled a large amount of money on a game of chance with odds that we know, then we hear a cry that could be either jubilation or despair coming from their apartment. The example is in “Should We Respond to Evil with Indifference” (Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 2004).\nOne reason for being a little careful with understanding Keynes in terms of this model is that for Keynes comparative probabilities are more fundamental than anything like sets of values. This is clear in, for instance, paragraph 14. I don’t regard this as a big problem because on my version of the sets of probability functions approach, comparative probabilities are also more fundamental. What makes a probability function a member of the set is that it conforms to all of the comparative judgments a person makes. So this isn’t a deal-breaker in terms of how we model Keynes, but it’s a reason to be careful."

His probabilities are extensions of the standard numerical notion. That’s to say, all logical truths have probability 1. I suspect he’s going to have to backtrack on this when the formal model gets rolled out.\nThis also undermines the idea that probability is continuous with logic. Whether p entails q does not depend on whether anyone can figure it out. There are logical truths that are determinable in theory, but far beyond anyone’s ability to figure out.2828 I don’t mean here to get into metaphysical waters about incompleteness.

But I should flag that they are not the standard view, at least of linguists, in contemporary theory.\nThere is a long running dispute about what we might call the metaphysics of gradable adjectives. As is well-known, a lot of gradable adjectives come in three types:\n\nPositive: e.g., she is tall; he is smelly.\nComparative: e.g., she is taller than she was; he is smellier than he was.\nDegree: e.g., she is 175cm tall.\n\nI’ve left off the smelly one at the end, because we don’t have (in natural language) a scale for it. Anyway, the metaphysical question I have in mind is (in contemporary lingo), which of these classes of facts grounds the others?\nI think the grounding goes from earlier to later: positive facts ground comparatives, and comparative facts ground degrees. And this was not an uncommon view in the 20th century.29 But Chris Kennedy convinced a lot of people that the order of (metaphysical) explanation went in the other direction: if she is taller than him, that is because she has some height and he has a height of a lower degree30. And he means this to apply even when we don’t have terms in the language for them. If he is smellier than her, that’s because he has some degree of smelliness, and she has a lesser degree.29 For an excellent statement of this view, see Ewan Klein’s “A Semantics for Positive and Comparative Adjectives” (Linguistics and Philosophy 1980). I still think this is basically correct, but this is a very lonely view nowadays.30 See his “Polar Opposition and the Ontology of Degrees” (Linguistics and Philosophy 2001), and “Vagueness and grammar: The semantics of relative and absolute gradable adjectives” (Linguistics and Philosophy 2007).\nIt is important to note that the Kennedy picture is not inconsistent with the broader Keynesian outlook. The degrees that he posits might only form a pre-order, not a total pre-order. But his view is, I think, inconsistent with the (sensible! correct!) view Keynes takes in paragraph 16, which is to make comparative probabilities the metaphysically central notion."

It’s (relatively) easy to understand arithmetic operations on sets of probability functions; you just perform the operation on each member of the set. So the (set-valued) values of Pr(p) and Pr(q) naturally yield a set value for Pr(p) times Pr(q).

    "text": "First, a confession. Although I’ve talked about the Treatise a lot both here and in written work, before this class I’d never really sat down to read it from start to finish. I basically read it as a collection of somewhat connected papers, reading whatever chapter was relevant to my then interests. Relatedly, I always read it in light of how we now think about things, not ever really trying to get a sense of what it meant to Keynes, or in Keynes’s time.\nNow that’s not entirely a bad way to do things. I think it’s fine to have a very instrumental approach to history of philosophy, reading it to see what it can tell us about things that are independently interesting. Indeed, that’s usually my view. But sometimes you can overdo it, and be too instrumentalist about how one reads. And that can lead to missing things that are, I think, somewhat interesting. On that note, a second attempt to get clear on what Keynes means by probabilities being logical.\nThere are four ways to understand an author when they say that their theory has some feature.\n\nLook for their definition of the feature. That’s not much help here since Keynes I don’t think is ever particularly clear about what it is to be logical.\nLook at common usage at the time of the term they use. That maybe would help, but I’m not going to have us sit through three volumes of Principia Mathematica to figure this out. I’ll leave that to more serious historians.\nLook at the argument they give for the feature. This turns out not to help because the argument Keynes gives is really bad. He just argues that probabilities are necessary and a priori. And while that’s interesting, it really isn’t enough to be logical in any interesting sense.\nLook at how they apply that feature. And here we might be getting on to something. Because the discussion at the end of chapter 4, and into chapter 5, suggests something about a stronger thing Keynes might have meant. And it is, I think, interesting enough to digress into.\n\nChapter 4, and onto chapter 5, have an odd place in the history of philosophy. The first half of chapter 4 is the best place to find a clear early statement, in English, of the problems with Indifference. It’s a devastating tour de force of objections. But the second half does not do what you expect if you only know the first half. It doesn’t say “Indifference, begone!”. Rather, it says that it’s time to find a restricted version of Indifference that avoids the (many, many) problems, and that this restricted version will ultimately be the basis for all probability.\nWhy might that be relevant. Well, think about four properties that we expect a logical relation to have. To be concrete, let’s focus on what it means for a particular sentence to be a logical truth, like a particular substitution instance of Peirce’s Law: \\(((p \\rightarrow q) \\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow p\\).\n\nNecessity: This sentence is true in all possible worlds.\nA Priori: It is knowable a priori that this sentence is true.\nAnalyticity: This sentence is true in virtue of its meaning.1\nFormal: This sentence is true (and perhaps necessarily, a priori true) in virtue of its form.\n\n1 There is a connection here to Keynes defining probability as a relation between sets. There is an argument, perhaps due to Michael Dummett, that Peirce’s Law is not a logical truth because it isn’t true in virtue of its meaning. And the argument turns on identifying the meaning of \\(\\rightarrow\\) with its role in a deduction system where arguments have many premises but just one conclusion. If you allow multiple conclusions, Peirce’s Law is analytic. I can say much more about this if anyone’s interested, but it’s really a digression.Now when Keynes introduces the idea that probability is logical, he only really talks about 1 and 2, and that’s why I was kvetching last week that we don’t get a lot here. And, I thought, we really need at least 3, and ideally 4. But we don’t get it. And, as we now know, we can’t get it. The argument for this has two steps. The first step is to identify 4 with the following constraint.\n\nFormal-New: Any sentence with the same form as this one is also true (and ideally also has 1, 2, and 3).\n\nThe second step is to show that probability relations do not satisfy 5. That’s easy enough given some concepts that we have and Keynes did not have. Start with the following definitions.\n\nAn emerald is grue iff it is (a) examined by some human and green, or (b) not examined by any human and blue.\nLet \\(h_1\\) be that lots of us have examined lots of emeralds in lots of places, and they’ve all been green.\nLet \\(h_2\\) be that lots of us have examined lots of emeralds in lots of places, and they’ve all been grue.\nLet \\(a_1\\) be that the next emerald a human examines will be green.\nLet \\(a_2\\) be that the next emerald a human examines will be grue.\n\nNow the problem for Keynes. First, \\(a_1/h_1\\) is very high. Second, \\(a_2/h_2\\) is very low. Third,\\(a_2/h_2\\) has the same form as \\(a_1/h_1\\). Then we can reason.\n\nProbability does not satisfy Formal-New.\nTherefore, probability does not satisfy Formal.\nTherefore, probability is not logical, contra Keynes.\n\nNow question, where would Keynes reject this reasoning? Maybe he wouldn’t, maybe he’d say that oops, hadn’t thought about that example, back to the drawing board. And look, that’s not an unreasonable guess; he really didn’t know about ‘grue’. But let’s see if we can do a little better.\nWhen I was a student, and probably when any of you were students, there was no sharp distinction made between Formal and Formal-New. I think in the textbooks I used, Formal-New was just taken to be the translation of Formal into a mathematically precise language. But there are two important things to note about this. First, it really is a theory of how to understand 4. Second, it wasn’t (to the best of my knowledge) a theory in Keynes’s time.2 What happens if we reject the analysis of Formal as Formal-New, and hence the step from 1 to 2 in the last argument?2 Again confession time: I haven’t read nearly enough of Principia Mathematica to be sure about this, but I’m pretty confident that it is from circa the 1930s.\nThere are some twentieth century precedents for this? Not, to be sure, one Keynes could possibly have known about, but there are precedents. In so-called positive free logic, the inference from \\(Fa\\) to \\(\\exists x: Fx\\) is valid iff \\(F\\) is ‘positive’. So you can infer from Brian is Australian to There is an Australian, but not from Santa Claus is unreal to Something is unreal. This is usually spelled out as a constraint on the possible interpretations of the predicates: \\(F\\) is only allowed to designate some positive property, like Australian and unlike unreal. In some non-normal modal logics, if \\(p\\) is a primitive sentence-letter, then \\(\\diamond p\\) is an axiom. Again, it’s important here to put constraints on what sentence letters can designate. You can’t have \\(p\\) mean \\(a \\neq a\\), for example. These are obscure logics (to put it mildly), but they are definitely logics.3 Maybe some similarly restricted notion of ‘same form’ can rescue Keynes here. That actually seems plausible to me, but I want to try a more twenty-first century defense instead.3 You can read about both of them in Graham Priest’s quite incredible Introduction to Non-Classical Logics. He thinks they are pretty weird, which is something coming from Graham Priest, but he does carefully set them out.\nThe understanding of Formal as Formal-New follows a very common twentieth century paradigm. We understand claims of the form X is true in virtue of Y as invariance claims: No variation in X without variation in Y. That’s what’s going on here. Formal is an in virtue of claim: Peirce’s Law is true (/necessary/a prior) in virtue of its form. Formal-New is an invariance claim: you can’t change the truth (/modal status/epistemic status) of an instance of Peirce’s Law without changing its form. Merely changing its non-formal elements (i.e., the meanings of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)) won’t be enough. In the twentieth century, these understandings of ‘in virtue of’ claims as invariance claims were everywhere in metaphysics, theory of mind, logic, epistemology, and elsewhere.44 The invariance claims were usually taken to be necessary truths, but they need not be. Jerry Fodor’s asymmetric counterfactual dependence theory of mental content is an invariance theory where the invariance is contingent.\nIn the twenty-first century, there has been a huge, discipline wide, rejection of the equation of these two types of claims. This largely traces to work Kit Fine did in the early 2000s, though it didn’t really take hold until around 2009. It’s often thought that that the connection fails in both directions.\nYou can have invariance without the in virtue of claim being true. I’m Australian in virtue of being born in Australia. But it’s not true that: I’m Australian in virtue of God knowing that I was born in Australia. And that’s the case even if it’s necessary that God knows everything, and so there’s no variation in my nationality without variation in God’s knowledge of where I’m both.\nAnd (I think, though not everyone agrees), you can have in virtue of claims being true without the invariance claim being true. Assume, as I think is right, that lying is wrong other things equal, but sometimes there are good reasons to lie. And assume that x lies in a situation where there was no good reason. Then I think this is simply true: x did something wrong, and it was wrong in virtue of being a lie. But I think this isn’t true: x did something wrong, and the moral status of x’s act couldn’t change without changing whether it was a lie. The last thing is false because if there were special circumstances, it would have been ok to lie.\nI suspect the best way to interpret Keynes, the way that makes him say the most interesting and plausible things, is to similarly say that he rejects the understanding of Formal as an invariance claim. True instances of Indifference are true in virtue of their form. That does not mean that anything with the same form is also true, any more than saying that x’s action is wrong in virtue of lying means that all lies are wrong. What it does mean is that when you have a correct instance of Indifference, it’s the formal features of the claim that explain why it is true, and which make it true. (Compare: In normal circumstances, it’s that it’s a lie that explains why it is wrong, and which makes it wrong.)\nI don’t mean to say this strategy will work. It certainly doesn’t do enough to save the details of Keynes’s theory, which we’ve known at least since Carnap’s Logical Foundations of Probability (1950) don’t work out. But maybe it saves the idea that if (a) there is a restricted formulation of Indifference that works and (b) all true probability claims are ultimately derivable from true instances of this restricted formulation, then (c) it would be fair to call the theory logical."

    "section": "Countable Additivity",
    "text": "Countable Additivity\nFirst, I thought that the PoI would lead to some kind of problem with countable additivity. Keynes is careful to say that he only intends the PoI to apply to finite cases. But it’s very hard to get a philosophical principle here that doesn’t lead to countable additivity violations. Here’s the basic idea.99 Jake Ross has a couple of papers on Sleeping Beauty, one in Phil Review and one in Phil Studies that make a similar point. And I make a similar complaint, less clearly, in my objection to Adam Elga’s version of the PoI in an old PPR paper.\nThe cash value of Keynes’s version of the PoI is the following idea. Let \\(\\phi(x)\\) be some propositional radical such that \\(\\exists x: x \\in S \\wedge \\phi (x)\\) is known (and is more or less trivial) for some set \\(S\\), and so is \\(\\forall x \\forall y (\\phi(x) \\wedge \\phi(y)) \\rightarrow x = y\\) is also trivial. In words, exactly one thing is \\(\\phi\\), and it is in \\(S\\). And let the evidence \\(h\\) be symmetric with respect to any two substitution instances \\(\\phi(a), \\phi(b)\\), at least where \\(a, b \\in S\\). Then what Keynes really wants is that \\(\\phi(a)/h = \\phi(b)/h\\). And that sounds kind of plausible enough, perhaps even after everything that we’ve seen previously in chapters 3 and 4.\nThat principle works fine when \\(S\\) is finite; the probability of any one thing being the \\(\\phi\\) is \\(1/|S|\\). And it works fine when \\(S\\) is uncountably infinite. The probability of any one thing being the \\(\\phi\\) is 0, but that’s probably what we want. And you can’t deduce any annoying things about cube volumes or substance density from these 0 values.1010 Does everyone understand why? Maybe we should pause over this if not.\nBut it very much does not work when \\(S\\) is countably infinite. In that case we get that the probability of any one thing being the \\(\\phi\\) is 0, but the probability of one of these things being the \\(\\phi\\) is 1. So the probability of this countably infinite disjunction, i.e., the first one is the \\(\\phi\\), or the second one is, or the third one is, or …, is not equal to the sum of the probability of the disjuncts.\nNow it’s a very big question in the last 100 years of philosophy of probability whether countable additivity is a requirement. It’s somewhat disappointing that Keynes doesn’t really address it. Indeed, he just seems to treat the only salient division among sample spaces to be finite vs infinite, whereas the modern tendency is to treat the big division as finite vs countably infinite vs uncountably infinite. Plenty of people think that it’s obviously true that you can have an equiprobable distribution over a countable set, so finite additivity must fail. And there are other reasons people have had for rejecting countable additivity.11 Still, I think countable additivity is a good constraint, and if the PoI violates it, all the worse for the PoI.1211 Dmitri Gallow, formerly of this parish, just posted a note arguing against countable additivity on grounds that should appeal to a Keynesian, because it appeals to the idea that conditional distributions are primitive. I think it’s a variant on the idea that if X is a flat distribution over the reals in [0, 1], then conditionalising on the evidence that X is rational will give you a violation of countable additivity. But that’s simplifying Dmitri’s views a little bit I suspect.12 If we have time, I’ll go over the conglomerability argument for countable additivity, and maybe why not everyone buys it."

It’s all about whether the competing claims, which are meant to be equiprobable, can be put into the form \\(\\phi(a), \\phi(b)\\). The contrast is with semantic constraints on indifference principles. Adam Elga, in his Dr Evil paper, has such a principle13. Two propositions are equiprobable iff there is the right kind of bijection between the sets of centred worlds the two propositions represent.14 And it’s very natural nowadays to have semantic versions of these principles.13 The paper is called “Defeating Dr Evil with Self-Locating Belief”, and it’s in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research.14 There’s a bunch of jargon in that last sentence, and I’m more than happy to go over it. But if you don’t want to know the details, the big picture point I’m trying to make here is that Elga’s version doesn’t look at how the two propositions are textually represented, but at the ways in which they are made true.\nThe syntax/semantics split here recurs in a bunch of related fields. It is kind of the same as the debate between proof-theoretic and model-theoretic conceptions of validity in philosophy of logic. And it is kind of the same as the debate between syntactic and semantic conceptions of laws in philosophy of science. And there are probably debates in metaphysics that have the same structure; or, if not, it’s only because the semantic side so comprehensively won.\nAnd outside of logic, the semantic side has basically been on a 75 year winning streak, for a fairly simple reason. A very widespread view (which I am definitely sympathetic to) is that syntactic approaches can’t help with anything to do with probability/epistemology because of the grue paradox. Maybe a syntactic approach with a restriction to a special subset of the language can work, but it would take some proving that it did work.1515 This is related to the points I was making about logicality.\nKeynes has a syntactic approach for a few reasons. One is that it’s the early 20th century, and nobody was using semantic approaches; everything was syntactic. Another was that the grue paradox hadn’t been discovered. And a third, perhaps most important, was that Keynes was really committed to the idea that he was extending logic here, and everyone (even the model theorists) agrees that logic has something to do with syntax.\nStill, when I read this my first thought was, Ah, Keynes is bringing syntactic weapons to a semantic fight, and this is bound to fail. So I started trying to come up with grue-like counterexamples to his theory. And I didn’t quite find them. Because there’s a more fundamental problem with the view."

He doesn’t quite have the example I’m giving below, but essentially the criticism I’m making here is in Carnap.\n\nThe Principle of Indifference is applicable to the alternatives \\(\\phi(a)\\) and \\(\\phi(b)\\), when the evidence \\(h\\) is so constituted that, if \\(f(a)\\) is an independent part of \\(h\\) (see §14) which is relevant to \\(\\phi(a)\\), and does not contain any independent parts which are irrelevant to \\(\\phi(a)\\), then \\(h\\) includes \\(f(b)\\) also.\n\nWhat is an ‘independent part’? When we look back at 14, we find this.\n\nIt will be convenient to define also two other phrases. \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) are independent and complementary parts of the evidence, if between them they make up \\(h\\) and neither can be inferred from the other.\n\nBut now we have a problem. For any \\(h, \\phi\\), we can define an \\(f\\) as follows\n\\[\nf(x) =_{df} (h \\vee \\phi(a)) \\wedge (h \\rightarrow (a=x))\n\\]\nIf \\(x=a\\) that is entailed by \\(h\\), and together with \\(h \\vee \\neg \\phi(a)\\) entails \\(h\\). So those two are complementary and independent, and hence \\(f(a)\\) is an independent part of \\(h\\). But \\(f(b)\\) is false given \\(h\\), so clearly not part of \\(h\\). So for any \\(h, \\phi, a, b\\) there will be an \\(f\\) such that \\(h\\) includes \\(f(a)\\) and not \\(f(b)\\), and \\(f(a)\\) is an independent part of \\(h\\).\nDoes \\(f(a)\\) satisfy the other clause Keynes gives that it “does not contain any independent parts which are irrelevant to \\(\\phi(a)\\)”? I’m not sure. This has gone on long enough, and maybe I’ll leave that one as a question for the readers."

    "text": "Setting Up the Problem\nOur investigator is bored one day, so they start flipping a coin. And, being an investigator, they write the results down. First Tails, then Heads, then three Tails in a row, and so on. The effect this has on the investigation is zero; completely and utterly zero. This doesn’t add anything to the investigation. It is evidence; it could affect our probability that the coin is biased. But it isn’t evidence that’s relevant this investigation.5 So it shouldn’t add to the weight.5 If weight is just a function of how much total evidence one has, then we’d have \\(V(a/h) = V(b/h)\\) for any \\(a, b\\). And Keynes explicitly doesn’t want that, and it becomes really important in the economic work that it isn’t right.\nThat sounds like an easy enough problem to solve. Say that \\(V(a/hh_1) = V(a/h)\\) if \\(a/hh_1 = a/h\\). That is, if \\(h_1\\) doesn’t change the probability of \\(a\\), it doesn’t change the weight of \\(a/h\\). In this case, \\(a\\) is the old hypothesis about COVID-19, \\(h\\) is the old evidence, and \\(h_1\\) is that this coin flip landed heads.\nUnfortunately, there are several problems with this. Start with the following problem. Imagine that there are two investigators looking into \\(p\\). One of them is off sick for a couple of days. While they are out, the first investigator discovers \\(h_2\\), which raises the probability of \\(p\\). On Tuesday, they discover \\(h_3\\), which lowers the probability of \\(p\\). On Wednesday, when the second investigator comes back to work, and they are told of what was found while they were away, i.e., \\(h_2h_3\\), the probability of \\(p\\) is unchanged. But the weight has surely risen. After all, it rose on Monday and again on Tuesday. So adding \\(h_2h_3\\) raises the weight. So sometimes, adding an independent bit of evidence raises the weight.\nThere is a formal version of this problem. Assume that for any \\(x, y, z\\), if \\(y, z\\) are logically equivalent, then \\(V(x/y) = V(x/z)\\). That is, assume substitutivity of logical equivalents within a weight operator. Then note that \\(h_1\\) is logically equivalent to \\((h_1 \\vee p) \\wedge (h_1 \\vee \\neg p)\\). Then we can reason as follows. I’ll also assume something that I think we can’t do without, namely that on the right hand side of \\(a/h\\), set theoretic union is conjunction. That is, adding two bits of evidence is equivalent to adding their conjunction.66 Keynes certainly writes as if this is a trivial assumption in many places, and I don’t think it’s avoidable.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nV(a/h) &= V(a/hh_1) \\\\\n   &= V(a/h \\wedge ((h_1 \\vee p) \\wedge (h_1 \\vee \\neg p)) \\\\\n   &= V(a/h \\cup \\{h_1 \\vee p\\} \\cup \\{h_1 \\vee \\neg p\\}) \\\\\n   &&gt; V(a/h \\cup \\{h_1 \\vee p\\}) \\\\\n   &&gt; V(a/h)\n\\end{align*}\\]\nAnd oops, we have a contradiction. How could we avoid this? I can see two options that are relatively simple, and which don’t seem attractive, and one that is less simple, but might do the trick."

We know (in some intuitive sense of ‘know’) that it won’t make a difference going forward. It’s not just irrelevant given \\(h\\), it’s irrelevant given any reasonable extension of \\(h\\).\nCompare this kind of case. We’re gossiping and trying to figure out if Jack and Jill are dating. Someone adds that they saw Jack at a couple of places last night; having hamburgers early in the night at Blimpy and then at the comedy club later. That doesn’t seem like it moves the probability that Jack and Jill are dating one way or the other. Then someone else adds that they saw Jill at both these places. That could be a coincidence, but that’s a bit of interesting information.\nSo what’s happened there is the first bit of information, where Jack was, is arguably independent of whether Jack and Jill are dating. And similarly on its own, the information about where Jill was, is also independent. But put those two pieces of information together, and now we have something. Hardly conclusive proof, but enough of a probability shifter to make fun gossip.\nIntuitively, it seems that we want to say is that new evidence raises the weight if it changes the probability, or it could change the probability in the future. This doesn’t on it’s own solve the problem. Go back to the coin flip, and let \\(h_1\\) be a proposition about the coin flip. For any \\(a\\), we could learn \\(h_1 \\supset a\\), and then \\(h_1\\) would be relevant. I think what’s going on is that while we logically could learn that, it’s not going to happen. There is no reasonable world in which we learn a material conditional connecting a coin flip to the origins of COVID, and nothing else. So here’s my worked out hypothesis.\n\nGiven \\(h\\), there is a set \\(S\\) of things that are possible items of future evidence.\n\\(V(a/hh_1) &gt; V(a/h)\\) iff for some \\(e \\in S: a/heh_1 \\neq a/he\\).\n\nThis won’t quite work for a reason we’ll get to below, but it’s progress.

And then \\(h_2h_3\\) would be relevant to \\(p\\). So I think this does the job that Keynes introduced general irrelevance to do. The problem is that there are three other issues that I don’t think Keynes has the start of an answer to, and I’m not really sure what to say about them."

    "text": "How Many Scales?\nThe issue of how the weighing metaphor works is one of the biggest topics in philosophy in the last 15 years. The starting point for this is Joshua Gert’s paper “Normative Strength and the Balance of Reasons”.8 In 2016 there was a useful edited collection on the topic by Errol Lord and Barry Maguire.9 And there has been a flood of work since. There are two issues that come up in this literature that I’ll briefly mention.8 Philosophical Review, 20079 Called simply Weighing Reasons, and Jussi Suikkanen has a useful review of it in NDPR.\nOne important bit of background is that in the usual division of philosophical topics, this has all been taking place in what we think of as ethics, not what we think of as epistemology, let alone probability. But I think it’s fundamentally the same set of problems. The folks in the ethics literature have all been talking about weighing reasons, but it’s commonly (and I think correctly) thought that evidence is a kind of reason, so weighing evidence is the same set of issues.\nThe topic that has been central to this debate in ethics I don’t think is relevant here. Assume that you think that there are actions that are permissible but not obligatory. And not just because they are tied for best with some other actions; they are permissible but other actions are better. What should we say about the weight of reasons in favour of the less good, but permissible, action? If it’s less than the weight of reasons in favour of the other action, then why is it permissible? If it’s the same as the weight of reasons in favour of the other action, why is the other better?\nThe standard solution here is to say that there are (in the metaphor) two kinds of scales: a permission scale and an obligation scale. And the options are tied on one and not on the other. I don’t really love this move; it seems like the two should be integrated more. But anyway, I don’t think it’s relevant here since I don’t think this division between permission and obligation is relevant.1010 Maybe that’s going to be wrong at the end, given what we say about the General Theory. But I think it’s a separate issue."

    "text": "Adding Weights\nKeynes seems to miss the relevance of a deeply Moorean point here: evidence satisfies an organic unity principle. (Confirmation is holistic, in slightly more updated lingo, but I prefer the Moorean terms.) Think again about the Jack and Jill example. What’s the weight of each piece of evidence? Honestly, not that much. But the weight of their sum is, intuitively, substantial.\nThis is one of the big points in the recent ethics literature, and I think it does create a problem here. The metaphor relies on the idea that bits of evidence are like blocks you put on a scale. But they don’t satisfy an organic unity principle. I think this is a reason to be sceptical of the whole ‘weighing’ metaphor. And without the metaphor, the idea of summing the weights of the two sides is a bit dubious."

    "text": "Defeaters\nThis is in some sense a version of the previous problem, but it’s distinctive enough to be worth it’s own note. Sometimes, evidence is defeated. Here’s a famous real-life example.1111 At least, it actually happened in the HBO series. I think it might have also happened in actual incident.\nAfter Chernobyl melted down, they were understandably worried about the radiation levels in the reactor and the surrounding area. So they got out the trusty Measure-Background-Radiation-Meter, and it read 3.6. That’s not great; it should be 0. But it’s not bad; it will take months of exposure at 3.6 to develop radiation linked illnesses. Let \\(a\\) be that people are in immediate danger, \\(h\\) the background information (i.e., that there was a meltdown), and \\(h_1\\) the reading of 3.6. Then it seems \\(a/hh_1 &lt; a/h\\), and that \\(V(a/hh_1) &gt; V(a/h)\\).\nIf you’ve seen the show, or read about Chernobyl, you know what comes next. It turns out the machine was capped out at 3.6; it simply wouldn’t show any higher.12 Let \\(h_2\\) be that the machine does not have a reading above 3.6. Then \\(a/hh_1h_2 \\approx a/h\\). But, and this is the important part, arguably \\(V(a/hh_1h_2) \\approx V(a/h)\\). It’s not just that the new evidence \\(h_2\\) pushed in the other direction to \\(h_1\\). It’s that it showed \\(h_1\\) wasn’t really evidence in the first place.12 I read somewhere that the cap was at 1/1000 per second, and the 3.6 was the rate per hour at 1/1000 per second. Capping at 3.6 seemed odd to me, but this might explain it.\nKeynes doesn’t have any way of capturing that. His core idea is that new evidence, i.e., evidence that changes our view, adds to the weight. And I don’t think that’s the case. Sometimes it tells us that what we thought was evidence was not in fact evidence.\nThere is a small literature on how to model this kind of defeat in probabilistic terms.13 I don’t know that literature particular well, but I didn’t get the sense that there was a clear way of getting the models to work. We need a way of differentiating evidence that undermines previous evidence, from evidence that simply points in the opposite direction. Imagine if instead of \\(h_2\\) we’d discovered \\(h_3\\), that people near the reactor had a particular condition that meant even at 3.6 they were in immediate danger. That would raise the probability of \\(a\\) back up, but intuitively in a way that did increase the weight. Just looking at probability kinematics, adding \\(h_2\\) and adding \\(h_3\\) have the same effect, but one decreases weight, the other increases it.13 Matt Kotzen, who’s visiting UM this week, has a paper going over some of the details.\nMaybe the idea I floated earlier about a future-directed view could help? In the real world, where we learned \\(h_2\\), we think \\(h_1\\) is useless, and will remain useless in any realistic scenario. Maybe after learning \\(h_1h_3\\), there is still some importance to \\(h_1\\) in this inquiry? At least, perhaps it could be relevant given some future learning?"

Since we know \\(a\\), and all of us here at least can do propositional logic, we can do \\(\\vee\\)-introduction to infer \\(a \\vee \\neg h\\). It’s trivial to show that \\(\\Pr(a \\vee \\neg h | h) \\leq \\Pr(a \\vee \\neg h)\\).

But \\(h\\) was our evidence, so we don’t know \\(a \\vee \\neg h\\) empirically, i.e., on the basis of our evidence. On the other hand, since \\(h \\wedge \\neg a\\) is coherent, we don’t know that it is false, i.e., that \\(a \\vee \\neg h\\) is true, on the basis of purely conceptual reasoning either. And everything we know we know either empirically or on the basis of conceptual reasoning. So we don’t know \\(a \\vee \\neg h\\). So we don’t know \\(a\\), contradicting our original assumption that we could know \\(a\\) on the basis of \\(h\\). Scepticism looms.\nThis last paragraph uses a lot of conceptual and mathematical machinery that was not available to Hume. But I think it’s a recognisably Humean argument. The proposition \\(h \\wedge \\neg a\\) says that one is in a particular kind of Bad Place, where someone has a past just like yours, but a future that goes wildly off in certain ways. And that argument, stripped of the mathematical machinery, asks how can you know you aren’t in that Bad Place. It can’t be by your evidence; your evidence seems to be in favour of your being in that Bad Place, relative to à priori probabilities.1 And it can’t be by mathematical or logical reasoning, since the Bad Place is coherent. So, problem.1 I started using the grave, even though it is a little ridiculous. Resa Hasidi pointed out to me that Russell was writing it this way in his early work, which is probably the connection to Keynes.\nKeynes’s solution to this Humean problem is, I’m sad to say, a little disappointing. He doesn’t care about knowledge in the ordinary sense, and simply accepts the conclusion of the argument. We do not in fact know anything beyond our evidence. Beyond that it’s all probability. It’s true that some coherent possibilities, like very particular Bad Places, have incredibly low probability. That’s all there is to say.\n\n\n\nAustralian philosophy in the era I came up in was full of views that the rest of the world thought were outlandish. Graham Priest argued that there were true contradictions. Jack Smart simply accepted the conclusion of any attempted reductio of utilitarianism. David Braddon-Mitchell argued that laws of nature could be false.2 Jeanette Kennett argued that being a good friend sometimes required being immoral.3 David Lewis, who was basically one of us, argued that dinosaurs and unicorns exist. But the view that really shocked everyone was when two professors at my old school, John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter, argued that good inductive arguments were logically valid.4 Even people who were willing to at least contemplate all of the earlier views listed thought this was a sign that something had gone seriously wrong in Australian philosophy, or at least philosophy at Monash.2 Maybe this one shouldn’t be there, since Nancy Cartwright had already said something similar.3 A friend helps you move houses. A real friend helps you move bodies. That apparently made her very unpopular with some Kantians, but I have some sympathy for it.4 “The Validation of Induction”, AJP, 1997.\nKeynes, however, is sort of on their side. And this explains how he responds to a different Humean argument. (The response is not explicit in the bits we’re reading, but I wanted to note it here.) Here’s what Bigelow and Pargetter thought. Consider the following argument.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of swans, in a lot of places, everywhere from Perth to Brisbane, and they’ve all been black.\nSo, all swans are black.\n\nI guess that conclusion isn’t very plausible, surely there are albino swans somewhere, so maybe we should restrict it.55 Keynes says something odd on roughly this point, which is relevant to the discussion of the cows example below.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of swans, in a lot of places, everywhere from Perth to Brisbane, and they’ve all been black.\nSo, the next swan I see will be black.\n\nBut look, everyone knows that even that’s a stretch. That albino swan might be waiting just in the next stream. So really, the argument is\n\nI’ve seen a lot of swans, in a lot of places, everywhere from Perth to Brisbane, and they’ve all been black.\nSo, probably the next swan I see will be black.\n\nBut let’s be clear about what probability claims are. They are claims about what is likely given one’s evidence. And I just told you what my evidence is. So really the argument should be.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of swans, in a lot of places, everywhere from Perth to Brisbane, and they’ve all been black.\nSo, probably the next swan I see will be black, given that I’ve seen a lot of swans, in a lot of places, everywhere from Perth to Brisbane, and they’ve all been black.\n\nAnd the thing is, that conclusion is, if true, necessarily true. On any broadly epistemic account of probability, if that evidence makes it probable that the next swan I see will be black, that’s a necessary truth. The world couldn’t be that I have that evidence, and it isn’t probable.\nBut it’s misleading at best to say this is a valid argument. It’s valid in the sense that any argument with a logically true conclusion is valid. But it’s not that the premises guarantee the conclusion; it’s that the conclusion is independently guaranteed.\nAnyway, this is all relevant to Keynes because the Humean problem of the previous section comes back. OK, so you agree that \\(h \\wedge \\neg a\\) is possible. And you agree that for that reason with evidence \\(h\\) you can’t know it isn’t actual. But this new knowledge you claim, that given \\(h\\), \\(\\not a\\) is really improbable, is this empirical or conceptual? The answer, Keynes gives, is the latter.\nNow this doesn’t really catch on because positivism happens. But Keynes is trying ever so hard to make this answer acceptable to positivists. One of the reasons chapter 19 is so dense is that he’s trying to work out a way in which it’s really part of logic that \\(h\\) makes \\(a\\) probable. He doesn’t really get there, I think, but it’s a bold effort.\n\n\n\nThat said, neither of these are the Humean problem that Keynes is addressing in these chapters. What he’s actually addressing is what we might call the problem of sheer repetition. How does getting more and more tasty eggs give us a stronger reason to think the next egg will be tasty? And his answer, roughly, is that on it’s own, it doesn’t.\nThere are a flurry of related problems here that I think Keynes is addressing. It’s worth separating them out.\n\nHow do extra repetitions provide extra evidence, given the intuition that they do not?\nIn general, what’s the relationship between reasoning by Pure Induction and reasoning by Analogy?\nWhy, when using Pure Induction, is it good to have a diverse evidence base?\n\nKeynes takes 1 to be the organising question. And his answer is, roughly, that Pure Induction is bad, but in practice the more evidence you’ve got, the better the analogy is between the next case and the existing cases. I think that’s a really interesting answer to a not so interesting question. I just don’t get the Humean intuition here that repetitions are intuitively not evidence. But I still think this is really interesting, because 2 and 3 are interesting questions, and Keynes’s answer is really interesting.\nLet’s take the above questions in reverse order, starting with 3. Why is a diverse evidence base important. It surely is important. If you visit hundreds of college campuses in the US, you might find patterns in them that it would be very irrational to project into non-US campuses. And the solution isn’t to visit a few hundred more campuses; it’s to visit non-US campuses. Russell, when spelling out a broadly Keynesian view in chapter 6 of Problems of Philosophy, doesn’t mention this. And it’s a glaring problem.\nBut why is it a problem? Why, philosophically, does having a diverse evidence base make for a better induction than a more numerous but narrower base? The answer, says Keynes, is that it’s always argument by analogy. The thing about having a diverse evidence base, is that it increases the likelihood that the next case is really closely analogous to one of the cases in your evidence set. That’s a neat idea I think.\nNow Keynes, because he shares the Humean intuition about sheer repetition, is committed to a really strong version of the idea. He thinks it’s only when you increase the probability that the next case is analogous to an old case that you get any better evidence. And I don’t think you have to think that to think that he’s got a good story about why diversity matters.\nHis story also has a couple of other nice features, both of which are related to question 2 above.\nWhen I teach induction, and this is roughly how I was taught induction, we are taught that there are these distinctive inductive methods. Keynes focuses on Pure Induction and Analogy; by the time I was a student we’d added Inference to the Best Explanation. Maybe these days some people would add Testimony.6 Why such diversity? Can we reduce the list a little? Yes, says Keynes; we can scrap Pure Induction.76 If this were a different seminar, I’d connect this to the old Indian debate about how many Pramāna there are. Are Induction, Analogy, IBE, and Testimony, all pramāna? I don’t think any Indian tradition would agree, but they’d understand the question.7 Historical question I have no idea about. In 1912, Russell says he’s presenting a Keynesian theory of induction, then makes Pure Induction, with no attention to diversity, the core of the theory. Is that what Keynes thought in the earlier versions? That might be worth archival study.\nThe other thing that’s tricky about the standard way of teaching is that we tend to say these things that are at best in tension, and probably outright inconsistent. But tension here is reflected in ordinary thought. Here are two things that we say.\n\nIn Pure Induction, you need a large evidence base. You can’t do induction on n = 1.\nIn Analogy, you don’t need a large evidence base. If you put your hand on a hot plate, and it really really hurts, you learn that’s dumb and don’t do it again. You don’t think, and you shouldn’t think, wow I wonder if that was a weird hot plate, or something that only happens in one or other hemisphere, or at a certain time of day? You get the very clear lesson, really hot things hurt.\n\nNow here’s the challenge. Why isn’t this latter inference a bad case of Pure Induction on n = 1? To be honest, I don’t actually have a great answer here. But I can at least see how there is a Keynesian answer. Mix Keynes’s view about Analogy being primary, with the idea that we can see what the relevant analogy is. To be sure, the latter part here is not part of Keynes’s epistemology; he has a very standard early 20th century view about perception as being little more than sense-data. But maybe the person who burns their hand can see something about what feature of the world is central to the analogy here. Maybe; I don’t have a worked out theory here."

But maybe the person who burns their hand can see something about what feature of the world is central to the analogy here. Maybe; I don’t have a worked out theory here."

    "text": "Analogy and Causation\nI briefly mentioned Indian theories above. I don’t know the relevant theories that well, but I think analogy doesn’t play a huge role in them. If I recall correctly, it plays some role in some theories, but not a huge one. Still, it’s bigger than the role Pure Induction plays, which is maybe a sign Keynes is a step closer to them.\nBut in a very important respect in which Keynes is rather different to these Indian theories, and to what I think is ordinary commonsense. Keynes thinks that these two epistemic methods are, at best, special cases of the general method of Analogy.\n\nSame cause \\(\\rightarrow\\) same effect.\nSame effect \\(\\rightarrow\\) same cause.\n\nKeynes thinks that in principle these are no better than a rule like same colour \\(\\rightarrow\\) same shape. It’s all just correlation matching. And that’s not a view you find, to the best of my knowledge, in other traditions, or in ordinary thought.\nNow the reason here isn’t too surprising. Keynes is very much a product of his time. And at the time Russell was very hostile to the idea of giving causation a central role in philosophy. There’s this famous quote from Bertrand Russell’s paper “On the Notion of Cause”88 Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1912.\n\nThe law of causality, I believe, like much that passes muster among philosophers, is a relic of a bygone age, surviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed to do no harm.\n\nThis I think has mildly disastrous effects on Keynes’s theory here. It’s an important part of ordinary thought that 1 is a better inference than 2. And this is something you see other epistemological traditions giving a central place to. But Keynes can’t get this being anything other than a contingent thing we’ve learned, if he can even get that. And while I can’t be sure, I suspect Russell’s influence was a big factor here.99 There is a historical connection here. One of the most famous uses of Analogy in philosophy is the design argument for God’s existence. Hume launches several criticisms of this argument, one of which is that it’s the wrong direction; it’s from effect to cause and that’s not a great analogical argument.\nHe does say one thing in Chapter 21 about why he doesn’t start with principles about causation. He’s aiming higher than you could possibly get with arguments about causation. He wants a general ground for the logic of inference about the unobserved. And this should work even in domains where there isn’t causation, and it should work before we’ve discovered the causal facts. (After all, we need to use it to discover general causal facts.) I guess I’m a little pessimistic about having anything this general to say, but this is perhaps an in-text reason to explain what a little role causation plays."

    "text": "Analogy and Tractarian Metaphysics\nI didn’t assign it for this week, but in chapter 22 there’s an attempt to derive Analogy from metaphysical first principles. I couldn’t quite make sense of it, but I think it went something like this.\nPosit, as a working assumption, that there is a special class of natural properties, or real universals. He calls these the ‘generator’ properties. And assume that there are only finitely many of these. If there are \\(k\\) generators, then there are \\(2^k\\) possible combinations of having and not having these.\nNow imagine we’re trying to figure out whether all cows eat grass. In Keynes’s term, we’re trying to find whether \\(F\\), being a cow, is invariably correlated with \\(G\\), eating grass. Given that there are only finitely many ways a thing could be, the \\(2^k\\) generator combinations, this means we’re trying to figure out whether a conjunction with \\(2^k\\) conjuncts is true:\n\nThings of type 1 are not cows, or they eat grass; and\nThings of type 2 are not cows, or they eat grass; and …\nThings of type \\(2^k\\) are not cows, or they eat grass.\n\nPut this way, we get some nice results. Assuming, as is plausible, that each of these conjuncts has positive prior probability, then every new type of cow we see that eats grass, the probability of the conjunction increases. And in the limit it gets to 1, assuming it’s true that all cows eat grass. And the more different the cows are that we see, probably the more of these conjuncts we can verify, so we get the result that variety is good.\nBut after a bit of thought I think this is quite absurd. Here are three quick reasons to worry.\nFirst, if there is literally any continuous quantity in the universe, the underlying metaphysics won’t work. Well, maybe that’s a bit strong; Keynes says that position in space and time have a distinctive role in his metaphysics, and he can maybe allow that they are continuous. But it seems pretty unlikely.\nSecond, while Keynes is right that the probability of the generalisation will have the right directional properties, it’s not like it’s going to get very high very fast. If each of these conjuncts is 50/50 to start with, then the generalisation will be incredibly improbable even if we have as much evidence as is humanly attainable. It’s not much help to say that the probability is incredibly low but rising.\nThird, there is a ravens paradox looming. If I’ve understood the view right, then we get just as much evidence that all cows eat grass when we see a novel kind of non-cow, as when we see a novel kind of grass-eating cow. Both of these rule out one way the conjunction could fail.\nMaybe these problems can all be fixed, but I’m not optimistic that it is going to work."

    "text": "Risk-Sensitivity\nKeynes doesn’t think that the expectationist approach is sufficiently sensitive to risk. In this respect his view looks like views that John Quiggin and, more recently, Lara Buchak5, have defended. The key thought is this:5 See her 2013 book Risk and Rationality for more details on this\n\nThe expected value approach “ignores the element of ‘risk’ and assumes that an even chance of heaven or hell is precisely as much to be desired as the certain attainment of a state of mediocrity.”\n\nBuchak puts forward a mathematical theory that is designed to not give this result. Keynes’s reason for not going down that road is interesting.\n\n“But if doubts as to the sufficiency of the conception of ‘mathematical expectation’ be sustained, it is not likely that the solution will lie, as D’Alembert suggests, and as has been exemplified above, in the discovery of some more complicated function of the probability wherewith to compound the proposed good. The judgment of goodness and the judgment of probability both involve somewhere an element of direct apprehension, and both are quantitative.”\n\nThe thought, as is so often the case in the book, is that we should be using mathematics to set out problems clearly, not to solve them. While this approach is attractive (at least to me), there are a couple of reasons to be sceptical on this occasion.\nFirst, in the years since 1921, there have been a number of arguments in favour of broadly expectationist approaches that seem to be plausible even in cases involving risk. Here’s one that I’ve been playing with recently.\nTwo coins are going to be tossed. Chooser knows the bias of each of them. That is, we don’t assume they are fair, but Chooser knows the chances. If the first lands Heads, chooser gets a payout of a, no matter what happens on the second. If the first lands Tails, Chooser has two options.\n\nA bet that pays b if the second lands Heads, and 0 if it lands Tails.\nA fixed payout of c, no matter how the second lands.\n\nHere’s the premise of the argument I’m working on. Which of 1 and 2 Chooser prefers shouldn’t depend on whether they (a) don’t know how the first coin landed, or (b) know that it landed Tails. (If it lands Heads they are presumably indifferent.) If this principle holds no matter the values of a, b, c, and the probability of the two coins, it’s hard to have any theory other than expected value maximisation.\nThis is a version of what’s known as the Sure Thing Principle. And since shortly after Keynes’s time, the Sure Thing Principle has been at the heart of debates about whether the expectationist approach is right. It’s disappointing that Keynes doesn’t have more to say about this kind of argument.\nSecond, Keynes’s intuition here depends on the idea that we have some independent way of latching on to the value of Heaven and Hell. That could well be questioned. It’s clear that Heaven is better than mediocrity is better than Hell. But I think Keynes is assuming that we can just tell that Heaven has value h, and Hell has value -h, and mediocrity has value 0, and then we can ask the further question about whether a 50/50 chance of Heaven and Hell is better or worse than mediocrity.\nFor what it’s worth, I find these intuitions about quantity very hard to detect. I can only tell that one state is half-way between two others in value by just asking about whether it’s better or worse than a coin-flip chance of one or the other. Maybe this is too sceptical/positivist on my part, but this is a big unargued for assumption Keynes is making. And it’s an interesting choice point among value theorists to this day. Which folks think that numerical values are prior to values of bets, and which think they are best understood in terms of values of bets?"

    "text": "Cluelessness\nAt the start of the chapter Keynes alludes to what is these days, following work by James Lenman, called the problem of cluelessness.7 You can’t say that best action involves doing what’s best in the future unless you think you have some decent sense of what the future will bring.7 See, for instance, his “Consequentialism and Cluelessness”, Philosophy and Public Affairs, 2000.\nThe next couple of moves in the dialectic you can probably guess. To act well we don’t need to know what will actually bring about good consequences, but only what probably will. But the future is so uncertain that even that is too hard. Here Keynes has a couple of things to say. Or, at least, he flags the two premises that he thinks the consequentialist will have to accept.\nThe first is something like a Principle of Indifference. I help someone at the shops. What consequences will this have? Who knows? What consequences will it probably have? Well, if I’ve got equal reason to think it will make things better or worse in the long run, and I know it will make things a little better in the short run, Indifference says I can cancel out the long run, and go with the short run considerations.\nThe second is that we need to rule out organic unities of a certain kind. Maybe the ‘better’ and ‘worse’ are equally likely, and equally good and bad, but one of the ‘worse’ options has a certain synergy with my action that means it ends up mattering more than the sum of the parts. That would again prevent the ‘cancelling out’.\nI’m very surprised that he thinks the organic unities worry is a bigger concern than Indifference. It looks like a completely terrible application of Indifference to me, at least by the standards we saw earlier."

    "text": "We’ll start with this rather blunt review Ramsey does soon after the book comes out. It’s a very strange document. The kill your elders tone is reminiscent of what would become standard in 20th century philosophy, though I guess it’s a little less common now. But it also does very little to contextualise the book. It’s almost like Ramsey published his notepads. The contrast with other reviews at the time, like Broad’s or Pigou’s, is even more striking. They do more than is currently standard to simply describe the book before getting into commentary. Ramsey does very little of this; practically none in fact. But this does mean we have more to work with.\n\n\nRamsey starts by objecting to the idea that probability can be non-numerical. The first objection is that we can sometimes get the benefits of saying that probability is non-numerical by simply saying the probability is not always defined. This seems like a weak objection to me for two reasons. First, if probability is going to be a guide, then it always needs to be defined. Second, sometimes what it means to say that probability is not numerical, is simply to say that certain things are not defined. On some modern views of imprecise probability, what it means to say that the probability of p is vague over an interval, just is to say that there is nothing ruling values in those intervals out. And the imprecise probability view can do something that the non-defined probability view cannot do.\nLet p and q be two completely unrelated propositions, such that Ramsey would say that the probability of p given q is undefined. Let h be that this coin I’m about to toss will land heads. What’s the probability of p \\(\\vee\\) h given q? Keynes, and modern imprecise theorists, can say that it is non-numerical, but it is at least 0.5. If probabilities are either undefined or numerical, you can’t even say that. But this seems wrong. This disjunction p \\(\\vee\\) h is surely more probable than some other propositions.\nThe second objection that Ramsey makes is considerably stronger. He argues that in many places Keynes confuses the unknowability of a probability with its not having a numerical value. And I think this is definitely true. At least some of the arguments do appear to turn on the fact that we can’t say what the probability would be. And Ramsey is right to complain that this kind of argument over generates. To use his example, the fact that we can’t say what the height of the distant mountain is, does not imply that it does not have a height. To argue that there really is no numerical probability for a certain proposition, we need to do more than say that we can’t tell what that probability is, or that no one can agree what it is. After all, the same could be true of the height of a distant mountain. I think there are things to say here, but it’s true that Keynes it’s not always careful to make these distinctions.\n\n\n\nAfter this, Ramsey discusses the uses of the principle of indifference. And I did not understand at all what the objection was supposed to be. He says that there are cases where the principal leads to paradox, which are not ruled out by the version of the principal which Keynes gives. But his example is one where the things the person is indifferent over can be divided into more cases. Indeed, they can be divided into cases that the person knows about. And one of the constraints on the principle of indifference that Keynes gives is that the case cannot be the divided. This restriction is a very tight restriction. I do not mean to argue that it is a good one. As far as I can tell, it rules out using the principle in any case, we might care to use it. What I do not understand is how one can say that it is still open to use the principle in cases like the ones that Ramsey describes.\nRamsey makes a positive suggestion about how the principle might be better restricted. His idea is that we can only ever be indifferent between instances of the same determinate. This is a very interesting idea and would be worth developing further. I don’t think it can be developed in any successful way within the metaphysical picture of the Ramsey himself endorses. On that picture I don’t know how you make sense of the idea of two things being determinables of the one determinate. But on a more plausible, realist, metaphysical picture, you can make sense of that idea, and that might be relevant to proper applications of the principle of indifference.\n\n\n\nAfter this, Ramsey makes it looks to me like a really uncharitable objection. He says that one of the arguments that Keynes makes does not go through because it requires an extra assumption, namely, that the values and question are unique. But surely that’s always an implicit assumption of the terminology being used. If you write x = y, that implies that y is the unique value of x. I’m not sure this really needed to be made as explicit as Ramsey says. It seems obvious to me that Keynes intended the values a/h to be unique. Here it really looks to me like he’s just publishing things that he scribbled in his own notepad.\n\n\n\nThe point about induction also seemed uncharitable as stated, but maybe there is a deeper point there. Ramses point is that we don’t just consider what the observed _F_s are like when deciding how likely it is that all _F_s are _G_s. Sometimes the fact that a particular non-F is non-G is relevant too. In particular, if something shares a lot of characteristics with the observed _F_s, but is not F, and is also not G, that raises the likelihood that the reason that the observed _F_s are all G is that there is a deep connection between being F and being G.\nThat said, this is a bit of a weird case. One of the two biggest worries1 in the philosophy of induction over the last century is that on some theories of induction, finding a non-F which is also not G will raise the probability that all _F_s are _G_s. And Ramsey’s response is, yes, sometimes we want the observation of a red ball to raise the probability that all ravens are black! I think Ramsey overstates how often this happens, but it does happen sometimes, and he’s got a point that Keynes’s way of doing induction might imply that it can never happen.1 To be clear, it’s the second biggest of the two. The biggest is what to do about grue.\nOn the bigger picture, part of what’s happening is that sometimes enumerative induction looks like a proxy not for argument by analogy, but as a proxy for inference to the best explanation. And when it does, these negative cases seem to matter. So I think there is a point here, even if I think it’s overstated somewhat.\n\n\n\nRamsey argues that Keynes’s principle of limited independent variety will imply that there are only finitely many objects. The argument goes as follows. Assume an infinity of objects. Assume also that being members of a common set suffices for sharing a property. Then there are infinitely many pair sets. So there are infinitely many properties. So limited independent variety fails. So limited independent variety requires there be finitely many things.\nThe point to object to here is obvious. You can’t have anything like the idea that being members of an arbitrary set is a property in the relevant sense on Keynes’s metaphysics. Indeed, it’s a really hard question whether you can do induction at all on this understanding of what a property is.2 But it seems really weird to attribute this kind2 That’s arguably a lesson of the grue paradox.\nHere we get to a real philosophical difference. K definitely needs there to be some restriction of the notion of property beyond being members of a common set. If you say any set of objects determines a property, then yeah the account of induction falls apart. If you think that, however, it isn’t clear what’s left of induction.\n\n\n\nApparently there is a point in the Treatise, and I didn’t go back to confirm this, where Keynes writes as if probability is a relation between propositional functions, not between propositions. This is surely a slip on Keynes’s part, but why it should be taken to have philosophical significance was not particularly clear to me. It certainly isn’t a reason to think that Keynes has generalised the notion of probability beyond what it will bear.\nRussell raised the question of whether we should think that propositional functions should be the primary bearers of probability. This is an interesting idea, and I’ve really just got two very initial thoughts on it. First, it would be a really really big break from how we do things now. Second, it would make the probability world much more frequentist friendly. Just what Ramsey’s relationship is to frequentism is perhaps an interesting question."

Ramses point is that we don’t just consider what the observed _F_s are like when deciding how likely it is that all _F_s are _G_s. Sometimes the fact that a particular non-F is non-G is relevant too. In particular, if something shares a lot of characteristics with the observed _F_s, but is not F, and is also not G, that raises the likelihood that the reason that the observed _F_s are all G is that there is a deep connection between being F and being G.\nThat said, this is a bit of a weird case. One of the two biggest worries1 in the philosophy of induction over the last century is that on some theories of induction, finding a non-F which is also not G will raise the probability that all _F_s are _G_s. And Ramsey’s response is, yes, sometimes we want the observation of a red ball to raise the probability that all ravens are black! I think Ramsey overstates how often this happens, but it does happen sometimes, and he’s got a point that Keynes’s way of doing induction might imply that it can never happen.1 To be clear, it’s the second biggest of the two. The biggest is what to do about grue.\nOn the bigger picture, part of what’s happening is that sometimes enumerative induction looks like a proxy not for argument by analogy, but as a proxy for inference to the best explanation. And when it does, these negative cases seem to matter. So I think there is a point here, even if I think it’s overstated somewhat."

    "text": "Ramsey argues that Keynes’s principle of limited independent variety will imply that there are only finitely many objects. The argument goes as follows. Assume an infinity of objects. Assume also that being members of a common set suffices for sharing a property. Then there are infinitely many pair sets. So there are infinitely many properties. So limited independent variety fails. So limited independent variety requires there be finitely many things.\nThe point to object to here is obvious. You can’t have anything like the idea that being members of an arbitrary set is a property in the relevant sense on Keynes’s metaphysics. Indeed, it’s a really hard question whether you can do induction at all on this understanding of what a property is.2 But it seems really weird to attribute this kind2 That’s arguably a lesson of the grue paradox.\nHere we get to a real philosophical difference. K definitely needs there to be some restriction of the notion of property beyond being members of a common set. If you say any set of objects determines a property, then yeah the account of induction falls apart. If you think that, however, it isn’t clear what’s left of induction."

    "text": "Apparently there is a point in the Treatise, and I didn’t go back to confirm this, where Keynes writes as if probability is a relation between propositional functions, not between propositions. This is surely a slip on Keynes’s part, but why it should be taken to have philosophical significance was not particularly clear to me. It certainly isn’t a reason to think that Keynes has generalised the notion of probability beyond what it will bear.\nRussell raised the question of whether we should think that propositional functions should be the primary bearers of probability. This is an interesting idea, and I’ve really just got two very initial thoughts on it. First, it would be a really really big break from how we do things now. Second, it would make the probability world much more frequentist friendly. Just what Ramsey’s relationship is to frequentism is perhaps an interesting question."

    "text": "Section 2 Criticisms\nRamsey starts with a very strange argument. He says that he’s arguing against the combination of the following two claims.\n\nProbability corresponds to rational degree of belief.\nProbability is non-numerical.\n\nAnd his objection assumes that degrees of belief can be numerically measured. And that objection seems, maybe, really not something that anyone sympathetic to Keynes would want to accept. It seems really question-begging. Of course if you have the rest of the views Keynes has, you’ll want something like non-numerical degrees of belief. And every modern theory like Keynes’s has that. It’s just an odd argument.\nThen we get one of the two most quoted parts of Ramsey’s paper:\n\nBut let us now return to a more fundamental criticism of Mr Keynes’ views, which is the obvious one that there really do not seem to be any such things as the probability relations he describes. He supposes that, at any rate in certain cases, they can be perceived; but speaking for myself I feel confident that this is not true. I do not perceive them, and if I am to be persuaded that they exist it must be by argument; moreover I shrewdly suspect that others do not perceive them either, because they are able to come to so very little agreement as to which of them relates any two given propositions.\n\nAs stated, this is clearly absurd. We all know that it’s more probable that Oswald killed Kennedy given our evidence than that an alien killed Kennedy. Lots of these relations are very easy to see in pretty broad outline. But he goes on to make some other more interesting arguments.\nFirst, when do we go from having (0, 1) probability to having something comparable to numerical probabilities? This is a hard question for anyone, and he’s right that there will be some kind of vagueness in the answer. Note we could make the same objection to the idea that some pairs of propositions don’t have a defined probability, as he suggested in the earlier paper. But probably whatever one does for vagueness in general will work here.\nSecond, it should be easiest to identify logical relations in simple cases, but here it’s easiest in hard cases. This does seem to be an interesting point. And it brings up a reason you might prefer an objective approach over a logical approach.\nThird, when we do know what the probability facts are (at least roughly) we always do that via thinking about ideally rational behaviour. That’s certainly what I was doing in the Kennedy example above. In modern terms, it’s kind of like probability facts are true because they are what ideally rational people would do, and not vice versa. Except Ramsey hasn’t quite shown that. What he’s shown is that facts about ideally rational behaviour are epistemically prior to facts about probability; that doesn’t rule out the probability facts being metaphysically prior. It seems common enough in philosophy that we think about what good people would do in a situation; that doesn’t make us all virtue theorists.\nFourth, Ramsey notes some points where Keynes doesn’t really adhere to his own theory. Most notably he discusses some paragraphs that we discussed too about the half-hearted attempt to bring non-ideal theory into probability. This is surely a mistake on Keynes’s part; he just has to pick one side and stick to it. I think these paragraphs are slips, and while they don’t reflect that well on Keynes, I don’t really think they are much evidence against his theory.\nFinally, he discusses a view on which probability is objective, but not itself a logical relation. The arguments against this seem not very strong to me, since it seems from a contemporary vantage point that the Tractarian project just didn’t have enough inputs to explain everything we wanted to explain philosophically.\nBig background point here: do we think any two people with the same evidence (in any possible worlds) should have the same degrees of belief? If so, we need something like what Keynes offers and Ramsey denies. In particular, we need something that has modal force, and which doesn’t have a clear relationship to the empirical facts. But Ramsey says that isn’t true; we should be reliabilists. And reliability is world-sensitive, and does not need to get a modal explanation."

    "text": "Section 4 Criticisms\nThere are I think four major criticisms here, which I’ll end this week by going over.\nFirst, Ramsey says that logic is just a matter of self-consistency, of accepting what is already contained in the premises. And that’s not true of induction. So induction is not part of logic.\nHere I think the best response is to say that the notion of ‘contained’ has stronger and weaker interpretations. On the stronger versions, what Ramsey says is only true of a very small range of logics. I don’t think it’s really true of higher-order logic (i.e., the logic of properties) or epistemic logic (i.e., the logic of knowledge). On a weaker version, where it just means that there is something incoherent about endorsing the premises and rejecting the conclusion, I think Keynes’s inductive logic satisfies it. There is something incoherent about saying that all the live grass I’ve ever seen has been green(ish), and none of it has been blue, and I have no special evidence about the next grass I’ll see (it’s not from a special place I’m told makes blue grass), but probably the next grass I see will be blue.\nSecond, Ramsey says that Keynes’s theory can’t justify the axioms of probability. This I think is a completely fair criticism, and Keynes doesn’t really have an answer here. Indeed, Keynes doesn’t even have a story about why his values are even the things that are capable of being added and multiplied, which is a precondition of satisfying the axioms. But I think Jim’s work solves the problems here. Thinking of real probabilities as sets of mathematical probabilities explains how they can be added/multiplied and accuracy considerations justify why they should satisfy the axioms. There are a lot of details to fill in here, but the short version is that while Ramsey is right that this is a gap in Keynes’s treatment, it is a fillable gap.\nThird, Ramsey says that an advantage of his pragmatic approach is that it lets us get by without the Principle of Indifference. And that’s true, and has advantages. But it has downsides too. Does it mean that induction is just a good habit, i.e., that as a matter of fact it actually works. In other words, does it just mean that it is reliable? If so, there are three very familiar challenges that we can raise next. First, we need to find the right reference class for saying that something is reliable. Second, we need a separate justification of conditionalisation, and I’m rather unsure the reliabilist can offer one. Third, we need to have something to say about why the evil demon victim is unlucky rather than stupid. These aren’t unresolvable problems, but it’s not like we eliminate philosophical headaches going this way.\nFinally, Ramsey makes an excellent point about Keynes’s theory having troubles with uncertain evidence. This is a problem to this day for broadly evidentialist theories (like my own). Maybe Keynes could appeal to things like Jeffrey conditioning to help here, but Ramsey is right that this is a challenge."
