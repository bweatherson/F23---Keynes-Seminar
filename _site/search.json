    "text": "I’m doing a seminar on John Maynard Keynes this fall (i.e., Fall 2023), at the University of Michigan. And because I’m old-fashioned, I thought I’d have a blog for the seminar. Apparently blogs these days have pictures, so here’s a famous picture of Keynes.\n\n\n\n1934 Cartoon of Keynes by David Low\n\n\nI’m a philosopher, and this is a philosophy seminar, so the course will be primarily about things that are philosophy in some very broad sense. We’re not going to get into the details of the Clearing Union, for example. But one thing I want to do with the seminar is stress how many different ways there are to be a philosopher, so we’ll stretch the limits a little bit of what is sometimes covered in philosophy. Still, a big focus will be on Keynes’s main work that is unquestionably an important philosophical work, the Treatise on Probability.\nHere is the tentative schedule for the seminar, which is very much subject to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nDate\nReading\n\n\n\n\n1\nAugust 28, 2023\nNone (intro)\n\n\nOff\nSeptember 4, 2023\nNone (Labor Day)\n\n\n2\nSeptember 11, 2023\nMy Early Beliefs.\nEconomic Possibilities for our Grandchildren.\n\n\n3\nSeptember 18, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 1-3\n\n\n4\nSeptember 25, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 4-5\n\n\n5\nOctober 2, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 6-9\n\n\n6\nOctober 9, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Chs. 18-20 (maybe also 21-23 if time)\n\n\nOff\nOctober 16, 2023\nNone (Fall Break)\n\n\n7\nOctober 23, 2023\nTreatise on Probability, Ch. 26\nBroad’s review of TP\n\n\n8\nOctober 30, 2023\nCritics of TP: Edgeworth, Ramsey, Feigl\n\n\n9\nNovember 6, 2023\nGeneral Theory Chs. 1, 2, 24 (23, optional)\n\n\n10\nNovember 13, 2023\nGeneral Theory.

Keynes works at a time and place that is often taken to be a turning point in the history of philosophy. I think his work represents a kind of path not taken for philosophy. There is a possible world where moral and political philosophy, and perhaps even political economy more broadly, is just as central to twentieth century Anglophone philosophy as it was to nineteenth century Anglophone philosophy. Just how and why that didn’t happen is I think an interesting question, and looking at Keynes is possibly one interesting way into it. But it would require someone with a much better grasp of academic history than me to teach such a course, so it will be an idea hovering around without ever quite being the focus."

    "section": "Foundations of Probability",
    "text": "Foundations of Probability\nKeynes’s 1921 book, A Treatise on Probability, is the foundation of work in formal epistemology in the last 100 years. It’s not as widely read today as it might be, because it was quickly surpassed in popularity by Ramsey’s pragmatist approach to probability. But it has three big advantages over Ramsey’s work. (Which is not to deny that Ramsey’s work also has distinct virtues; the aim here is to get everyone to read more, not to stop reading Ramsey.)\nOne is that it works out a lot of the interesting questions that arise from applying probability theory to problems in epistemology in much more detail than Ramsey does. This is largely a consequence of Keynes writing a book and Ramsey writing a handful of papers, only one of which is really widely read in philosophy of probability. But it’s still useful to see the original workings out of various problems in a probabilistic framework.\nAnother is that it develops the notion of weight, and with it some interesting ideas for the limits of the application of probability to human problems. Exactly what Keynesian weight is supposed to be, indeed whether there is anything coherent in it at all, is a tricky question. And it’s also a tricky question whether it has any practical significance. But Keynes clearly thought it did, and the notion makes a surprise guest appearance at a key point in his economic work.\nFinally, Keynes’s work grows out of a broad metaphysical picture, roughly Moorean realism, that is both more popular nowadays than Ramsey’s pragmatism/positivism, and is, at least in my opinion, more plausible. At least some of the early criticisms of Keynes were simply based in the incompatibility between his work and positivism. But that, most of us think these days, is a virtue not a vice. So it’s worthwhile revisiting what a realist approach to probability looks like."

One question that’s fascinating to me is whether there are places where we can see real connections between Keynes’s philosophical work, his theoretical work in economics, and his practical suggestions. Given how influential his practical suggestions were for half a century, the historical questions about the influence of philosophy on the world seem fascinating."

    "text": "Philosophical Questions in Economics\nThe previous point was about the influence from philosophy to economics, and hence to the wider world. But we should think about the reverse direction of influence too, and here Keynes’s work is again helpful. His economic writings include a lot of work on what we’d now call social metaphysics, including really interesting thoughts on the metaphysics of money, and the nature of inflation. He has a lot to say about questions about pooling, as in forming a group belief state, or value function, from individual believers or valuers. (Some of the work on the nature of inflation is relevant here too; similar questions arise.) And his work on developing the concepts that are the center of contemporary economic statistics, things like GDP, is a fascinating case study in conceptual engineering."

    "section": "History of Philosophy",
    "text": "History of Philosophy\nKeynes was an undergraduate at Cambridge in the early 1900s. In the decades before he arrived, philosophy and Cambridge (and to some extent across the UK) was a cross between what we’d now call PPE, and what we’d now call Cognitive Science. Henry Sidgwick was the dominant force at Cambridge, and the most important economists (as we’d now call them) of that time looked up to him. Keynes’s father wrote two books - one in economics and one in logic. Psychology at Cambridge was a subdiscipline of philosophy, on a part with metaphysics and ethics, and most important people you read in it were James and Dewey. And that movement back and forth between what we’d now call economics, psychology, and philosophy was completely common.\nBy the time Keynes died, philosophy had not only excluded economics and psychology (which has left to form their own thriving programs), it had largely lost interest in normative ethics and, especially, political philosophy. Since this time (and this place) are so central to the story analytic philosophy tells itself about how philosophy in the 20th century came to be, it’s fascinating to look at it through the lens of someone who started in philosophy, but ended up doing work that was off the radar of professional philosophers by the middle of the century.\nAt my most controversial, I sometimes think we should date the start of analytic philosophy not to Frege and Russell’s work on logic and mathematics, but to the work of Sidgwick, Jevons, and Marshall on what we’d now call formal epistemology/formal ethics. I’m really not going to defend that view in the seminar, I don’t even really believe it when stated that strongly. What I do think is that a history of analytic philosophy that gives moral and political philosophy, and philosophers, a more central place is a very worthwhile project. And Keynes’s life, and his wonderfully written biographies of figures in the generation that came before him, would be central to such a history."

    "text": "Political Philosophy\nKeynes never wrote a work in theoretical political philosophy. But he did write a number of works in what we might call applied political philosophy, including the most influential political book of its time, his critique of the Paris Peace Treaty. His political writings generate two fascinating questions. One is just what his political philosophy was. It’s a version of liberalism, and the simplest thing to say is that he fits alongside Constant and de Tocqueville as a liberal writing in revolutionary times. But it’s in at least some respects more radical than either of them, and it’s not easy to say exactly how his view fits into the history of political thought. A second question is whether his view is worth defending. At times he looks like someone who has seen the massive gains in well-being for a select group of people in the previous few decades, and wants to know how we can keep making further such gains, and make them available to more people. At others he looks like someone whose primary interest is in preserving what remains of the British Empire. We’ll spend a bit of time on both these questions in the seminar, though not in as much detail as we might. I think to answer either fully we’d need to really dig into the details of financial negotiations, and look at what political philosophy is pushing Keynes to try to steer the negotiations this way rather than that. And I don’t have the expertise (or the time) to explain enough of what was going on in these negotiations to do that. But it’s a question that is there in the background, and political questions will never be entirely removed from what we’re studying."

His biographical essays often include long discussions of the lineage of the subject, explaining their intellectual successes as a consequence of their ancestry. And he adored Galton, who seemed at time to rival only Einstein as his contemporary intellectual heroes."

He was aware of how racist the US was, especially in the south, and it made him personally uncomfortable when he was directly confronted with it on his travels. But he didn’t actually do anything about this discomfort, even though his contacts with FDR meant that he could possibly have done something. The urge to protest that was so vivid on other fields seems to have gone missing here. I suspect they are there somewhere, but I haven’t found any particular racist comments about Blacks, either from Africa or the Americas, in Keynes’s writings. What we get instead is that Blacks are almost invisible to him. They aren’t his concern. I don’t really know what a contemporary parallel to this is. I don’t mean this to be exculpatory; it’s obviously not great to just not care about a huge percentage of humanity. But it’s not the kind of racism you might expect."

    "text": "Anti-Semitism\nOn the other hand, he did make some terribly anti-semitic remarks. You see some of them already in “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren”, and there are worse remarks included in one of the pieces on Einstein in Essays in Biography.\nThis was obviously not just a case of indifference. Keynes interacted with many Jewish people. Here are just four prominent examples, though we could pick more. He employed Leonard Woolf for a while, effectively subsidising Virginia’s writing. He did a lot of work to deal with Wittgenstein’s many foibles. (I can’t prove this, but I really think he thought of his relationship with Wittgenstein as an echo of Hume’s relationship with Rousseau.) His closest collaborator in the 1930s was Richard Kahn, probably the one person Keynes most identified as being his student. (Kahn developed the concept of the multiplier, which became so central to practical applications of Keynes’s work.) And the name of his most important book was chosen as a deliberate homage to Einstein’s work.\nAnd despite all these personal interactions, he still managed to harbor some awful general attitudes about Jews as a group. I honestly don’t know how much this affected his personal interactions with individual people. There is some evidence that it damaged his relationship with Leonard Woolf, but it’s sketchy. It’s mostly just depressing that someone smart enough to know better, and with so much relevant evidence from personal acquaintances, could still fall into believing lazy stereotypes.\nKeynes had a lot more stereotypical beliefs (in both senses) about people from various European countries, with the stereotypes he had about French, German, and Welsh people being possibly the most notable in the ways they affected his work. On the whole these didn’t seem as pernicious to me, and instead point to interesting questions about where we draw the line between lazy stereotyping, and carefully observing general characteristics. There is something like a trigger warning before some of the papers in later versions of Essays in Biography on these points, though it seems unnecessary to me. In any case, I haven’t found anything in his generalisations about other European countries that’s nearly as appalling as the anti-semitic views he occasionally let slip out."

    "title": "Week 1: Keynes’s Life",
    "section": "The Moral Sciences Tripos",
    "text": "The Moral Sciences Tripos\nIn the late 19th century, if you were a Cambridge student interested in philosophy very broadly construed, the degree you took was called Moral Sciences. It was officially called the Moral Sciences Tripos, but exactly what a Tripos is, and why it was called that, don’t matter that much to our story. What matters is that it was a three year degree, and it was centred around examinations at the end of the second and third year.\nNote that this is in England, so it’s the English university system. And that’s a bit different to what you might be used to in America, Australia, Canada, Scotland, or elsewhere in the English speaking world. In England, in Keynes’s time as now, undergraduates take all their courses in the subject they are taking their degree in. I think this is part of the appeal of degrees like PPE in England; it means that students aren’t quite so concentrated. But it also means that just the sheer number of courses means that most students take a lot of courses in almost every sub-discipline of their degree. Relatedly, students in Moral Sciences were expected to complete a common exam, which covered the whole of the discipline.\nAnd what was the discipline of moral sciences? The best guide I’ve found is an 1891 student’s guide to the University of Cambridge, which includes a lot of advice for students taking Moral Sciences. That’s a little hard to read, but thankfully Irwin Collier, who has a fantastic site on archival artifacts from the history of economics has made an HTML version of the Moral Sciences part. He notes that Keynes, i.e., John Neville Keynes, contributed to the part of the guide on political economy. The guide describes in some detail what students should know for the two big exams, with this being the important overview.\n\nThe examination for the Moral Sciences Tripos consists of two parts; and begins, as a rule, upon the Monday after the last Sunday but one in May. No student may present himself for both parts in the same year. The first part consists of two papers on each of the following subjects: Psychology including Ethical Psychology; Logic and Methodology; Political Economy; together with a paper of Essays. …\nThe subjects of the second part of the examination fall into two groups:–(A) Metaphysics, Political Philosophy, Ethics–on each of which there is one paper–and (B) the following special subjects, History of Philosophy, Advanced Logic and Methodology, Advanced Psychology and Psychophysics, Advanced Political Economy. There are two papers on each of these special subjects besides an Essay paper containing questions on all the above subjects. Every student must take one, and may not take more than two, of the special subjects; also every student must take the papers on Metaphysics and Ethics except those who select Advanced Political Economy as a special subject: for such students the paper on Political Philosophy is provided as an alternative for Metaphysics.\n\nSo that’s what you had to do: psychology (including what we’d now call moral psychology), logic, politics/economics, and then in senior year, metaphysics (though you can opt out of that), political philosophy, ethics, history of philosophy, and advanced versions of the earlier material. Metaphysics, by the way, means largely what we’d call epistemology. The first topic is “Knowledge, its analysis and general characteristics: material and formal elements of knowledge; self-consciousness as unifying principle; uniformity and continuity of experience.”, and there are several more about certainty, coordination (social epistemology!), and others. Again, you can follow the links to see the details in what the parts that would now be considered philosophy consist in.\nThe economics and psychology parts are shot through with names that we’d consider philosophers. The economics section lists (John Stuart) Mill, Sidgwick, Jevons, (John Neville) Keynes, and, of course, Smith. The psychology section has Dewey and James as the most important figures. If you think about contemporary philosophy departments, this shouldn’t be a surprise. It’s natural that people in philosophy, as it is construed at a time, will know a lot about philosophy, as it is construed at that time. And at the time, philosophy included pretty much all of what we’d now call Cognitive Science, and pretty much all of what we’d now call PPE. (Michigan Philosophy is, in this respect, trying to return philosophy to its former glory.)\nBut a lot changed in 1903. It was a big year for Cambridge Moral Sciences. Moore published Principia Ethica, a book we’ll talk a lot about in this course. Russell published The Principles of Mathematics, which we won’t talk about at all after this sentence. And a campaign led by Alfred Marshall, but opposed by many others, finally succeeded in breaking off Economics from Moral Sciences, and creating its own tripos (i.e., degree).\nThis didn’t affect Maynard Keynes directly; he was a mathematics undergraduate. But it had a massive effect on his overall life. For one thing, it complicated his father’s position; when the split happened he naturally went into Economics, but it probably led to him doing less philosophical work than he otherwise might have. (Remember he had written the most important logic book of the years immediately preceding Frege and Russell.) But it also led to complications for Maynard’s position. He had obvious leanings towards economics, not least because he wanted to work in Treasury. But he also wanted to work on, for related reasons, Moorean ethics, and the foundations of probability. All of this would have been easier in the old Moral Sciences program than it was in the world that was created by the split. We shouldn’t overstate this - interaction between departments at Cambridge has always been very strong compared to other places, and it certainly didn’t stop Keynes talking with Russell about probability, or Edgeworth publishing on probability in Mind. And Keynes spent a lot of time (really, a lot of time) with Wittgenstein, so it wasn’t like he was out of the loop in philosophy. Still, I can’t help wonder what his career would have looked like had it been spent entirely in a department centred around philosophy.\nI’m going over this all at some length in part because it is so important to Keynes’s intellectual background, but in part because it seems more important to the history of analytic philosophy than is usually accounted for. I don’t know how much it comes up these days, but until circa 2010, the standard introductory course in a US analytic philosophy program (the pro-sem) was typically a course on the foundations of analytic philosophy, with a special focus on Frege, Russell, and (early) Wittgenstein. You saw variations on this theme, maybe some Moore here, some late Wittgenstein there, often some Kripke to make it more contemporary, but that was the basic idea. And so much of that story is taking place at Cambridge, in this middle of which the department these folks are in goes through this big split.\nOne thing you might notice from that list of names is that, with the partial exception of Moore, there isn’t much ethics there, and no political philosophy. (And it’s Moore’s meta-ethics, or his metaphysics and epistemology, that were covered in these courses, not his normative ethics. Of course Russell had a lot to say about politics, and political philosophy, but that’s not read much in contemporary philosophy.) Given how central Sidgwick was to the previous generation of Cambridge philosophers, that’s something of a surprise. I really don’t have the evidence for this, but it’s a speculation. One thing that I’ve seen after the few department splits I know about (Sydney in the 1960s, Irvine more recently) is that subjects that are sort of between the specialisations of the new department get a little left out. It’s more common to see neither department do them than to see both. I wonder how much losing political economy meant that the remaining philosophers thought that political philosophy wasn’t part of their jurisdiction any more, and/or that the people who might have been the Cambridge moral and political philosophers of the early 20th century simply moved departments in the split. As I said, I don’t really know if this is even a viable theory, but I think the split is an important and under-discussed part of a really significant moment in the history of philosophy."

    "section": "The Three Party System",
    "text": "The Three Party System\nTo understand some of the political debates that Keynes is involved with, it helps to have a sense of the political parties at the time. Great Britain had, for most of Keynes’s life, something like a three party system. I say “Great Britain” here because (a) the same parties were strong in England, Scotland and Wales, but quite different parties were strong in Ireland. But Keynes had next to nothing to say on Irish matters, and I’ll ignore the Irish parties from now on.\nFrom right to left, the three parties were the Conservative, or Tory, Party, the Liberal Party, and the Labour Party. You can get a bit of a sense of their strengths over time from this graph of the number of seats in the House of Commons they had after each election from 1895-1979. (though we’ll come back to why this is potentially misleading in a bit).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this was much more of a two-party system when Keynes was younger. I haven’t included them here, but the main Irish party had more members of the House of Commons than Labour for most of the time until Irish independence after WWI. Still, Labour was there, and after WWI became more and more important.\nKeynes was by inclination, upbringing, and social class, a Liberal. Indeed he was one of the more prominent Liberal public intellectuals for much of his life. For many of his political projects, convincing his fellow Liberals that he was right was a key part of his strategy. (Though he also often worked by trying to convince technocrats.) I believe he voted Liberal at every election in his life except 1945, when like practically everyone else he voted Labour.\nI’ve said that the parties could be arranged right-to-left, and that’s roughly right, but only roughly. The Conservatives were in some ways more religiously tolerant than the Liberals. They were much less anti-Catholic, going back to the two parties views on the Glorious Revolution. And they had a Jewish leader, Disraeli, which it is hard to imagine the Liberals having done. More importantly for our story, one of the big divisions between the parties was on trade. The Liberals were, almost as a matter of identity, pro-free trade, while the Conservatives were more protectionist. I don’t know how free-trade versus protectionism gets coded as left/right these days, but certainly at some times it has been coded as free-trade being the right-wing view here. When Keynes suggested that tariffs might be part of the best response to the Great Depression, this was as large a break from Liberal orthodoxy as he made any time in his life.\nNow there is one important sense in which everything I’ve said here was a bit misleading. From 1916 to 1926, the Liberal party was split into two factions, one organised around Asquith (the PM until 1916), and the other around Lloyd George (the PM after 1916). The two factions, although still in some sense part of the same party, contested elections against each other. Keynes was originally on Asquith’s side (because he agreed with Asquith about how to conduct the war, and then importantly about Versailles) but eventually switched to Lloyd George’s side (because of how hostile Asquith was to the general strike).\nIt’s also worth noting how much tighter the connection between academia and politics was in those days. Asquith, who was PM from 1908-1916, had a post-doc at Oxford. And Arthur Balfour, one of the most important Conservatives of the first two decades of the 20th Century, and for a short time PM himself, was a philosopher. He wrote several articles in Mind, as well as a book critically surveying the popular philosophical views of the late 19th century. His criticisms of idealism anticipate in some respects Moore’s more famous criticisms. And Balfour’s connections to philosophy proved very helpful to philosophers who got themselves into high profile scraps. He couldn’t keep Russell out of prison during WWI, but he did intervene to make sure Russell got particularly lenient treatment.\nKeynes seems to have had a real visceral dislike for most Conservatives. See for instance this rather pointed passage from his obituary for Asquith.\n\nHis temperament was naturally conservative. With a little stupidity and a few prejudices dashed in he would have been Conservative in the political sense also.\n\nBut Keynes’s obituary for Balfour, while somewhat impersonal, is very generous in its intellectual praise, favourably comparing Balfour’s early economic work in the 1890s to that of the more famous economists of the time."

    "text": "I\nWe are suffering just now from a bad attack of economic pessimism. It is common to hear people say that the epoch of enormous economic progress which characterised the nineteenth century is over; that the rapid improvement in the standard of life is now going to slow down—at any rate in Great Britain; that a decline in prosperity is more likely than an improvement in the decade which lies ahead of us.\nI believe that this is a wildly mistaken interpretation of what is happening to us. We are suffering, not from the rheumatics of old age, but from the growing-pains of over-rapid changes, from the painfulness of readjustment between one economic period and another. The increase of technical efficiency has been taking place faster than we can deal with the problem of labour absorption; the improvement in the standard of life has been a little too quick; the banking and monetary system of the world has been preventing the rate of interest from falling as fast as equilibrium requires. And even so, the waste and confusion which ensue relate to not more than 7½ per cent of the national income; we are muddling away one and sixpence in the £, and have only 18s. 6d., when we might, if we were more sensible, have £1; yet, nevertheless, the 18s. 6d. mounts up to as much as the £1 would have been five or six years ago. We forget that in 1929 the physical output of the industry of Great Britain was greater than ever before, and that the net surplus of our foreign balance available for new foreign investment, after paying for all our imports, was greater last year than that of any other country, being indeed 50 per cent greater than the corresponding surplus of the United States. Or again—if it is to be a matter of comparisons—suppose that we were to reduce our wages by a half, repudiate four-fifths of the national debt, and hoard our surplus wealth in barren gold instead of lending it at 6 per cent or more, we should resemble the now much-envied France. But would it be an improvement?\nThe prevailing world depression, the enormous anomaly of unemployment in a world full of wants, the disastrous mistakes we have made, blind us to what is going on under the surface—to the true interpretation of the trend of things. For I predict that both of the two opposed errors of pessimism which now make so much noise in the world will be proved wrong in our own time—the pessimism of the revolutionaries who think that things are so bad that nothing can save us but violent change, and the pessimism of the reactionaries who consider the balance of our economic and social life so precarious that we must risk no experiments.\nMy purpose in this essay, however, is not to examine the present or the near future, but to disembarrass myself of short views and take wings into the future. What can we reasonably expect the level of our economic life to be a hundred years hence? What are the economic possibilities for our grandchildren?\nFrom the earliest times of which we have record—back, say, to two thousand years before Christ—down to the beginning of the eighteenth century, there was no very great change in the standard of life of the average man living in the civilised centres of the earth. Ups and downs certainly. Visitations of plague, famine, and war. Golden intervals. But no progressive, violent change. Some periods perhaps 50 per cent better than others—at the utmost 100 per cent better—in the four thousand years which ended (say) in A.D. 1700.\nThis slow rate of progress, or lack of progress, was due to two reasons—to the remarkable absence of important technical improvements and to the failure of capital to accumulate.\nThe absence of important technical inventions between the prehistoric age and comparatively modern times is truly remarkable. Almost everything which really matters and which the world possessed at the commencement of the modern age was already known to man at the dawn of history. Language, fire, the same domestic animals which we have to-day, wheat, barley, the vine and the olive, the plough, the wheel, the oar, the sail, leather, linen and cloth, bricks and pots, gold and silver, copper, tin, and lead—and iron was added to the list before 1000 B.C.—banking, statecraft, mathematics, astronomy, and religion. There is no record of when we first possessed these things.\nAt some epoch before the dawn of history—perhaps even in one of the comfortable intervals before the last ice age—there must have been an era of progress and invention comparable to that in which we live to-day. But through the greater part of recorded history there was nothing of the kind.\nThe modern age opened, I think, with the accumulation of capital which began in the sixteenth century. I believe—for reasons with which I must not encumber the present argument—that this was initially due to the rise of prices, and the profits to which that led, which resulted from the treasure of gold and silver which Spain brought from the New World into the Old. From that time until to-day the power of accumulation by compound interest, which seems to have been sleeping for many generations, was re-born and renewed its strength. And the power of compound interest over two hundred years is such as to stagger the imagination.\nLet me give in illustration of this a sum which I have worked out. The value of Great Britain’s foreign investments to-day is estimated at about £4,000,000,000. This yields us an income at the rate of about 6½ per cent. Half of this we bring home and enjoy; the other half, namely, 3¼ per cent, we leave to accumulate abroad at compound interest. Something of this sort has now been going on for about 250 years.\nFor I trace the beginnings of British foreign investment to the treasure which Drake stole from Spain in 1580. In that year he returned to England bringing with him the prodigious spoils of the Golden Hind. Queen Elizabeth was a considerable shareholder in the syndicate which had financed the expedition. Out of her share she paid off the whole of England’s foreign debt, balanced her Budget, and found herself with about £40,000 in hand. This she invested in the Levant Company—which prospered. Out of the profits of the Levant Company, the East India Company was founded; and the profits of this great enterprise were the foundation of England’s subsequent foreign investment. Now it happens that £40,000 accumulating at 3¼ per cent compound interest approximately corresponds to the actual volume of England’s foreign investments at various dates, and would actually amount to-day to the total of £4,000,000,000 which I have already quoted as being what our foreign investments now are. Thus, every £1 which Drake brought home in 1580 has now become £100,000. Such is the power of compound interest!\nFrom the sixteenth century, with a cumulative crescendo after the eighteenth, the great age of science and technical inventions began, which since the beginning of the nineteenth century has been in full flood—coal, steam, electricity, petrol, steel, rubber, cotton, the chemical industries, automatic machinery and the methods of mass production, wireless, printing, Newton, Darwin, and Einstein, and thousands of other things and men too famous and familiar to catalogue.\nWhat is the result? In spite of an enormous growth in the population of the world, which it has been necessary to equip with houses and machines, the average standard of life in Europe and the United States has been raised, I think, about fourfold. The growth of capital has been on a scale which is far beyond a hundred-fold of what any previous age had known. And from now on we need not expect so great an increase of population.\nIf capital increases, say, 2 per cent per annum, the capital equipment of the world will have increased by a half in twenty years, and seven and a half times in a hundred years. Think of this in terms of material things—houses, transport, and the like.\nAt the same time technical improvements in manufacture and transport have been proceeding at a greater rate in the last ten years than ever before in history. In the United States factory output per head was 40 per cent greater in 1925 than in 1919. In Europe we are held back by temporary obstacles, but even so it is safe to say that technical efficiency is increasing by more than 1 per cent per annum compound. There is evidence that the revolutionary technical changes, which have so far chiefly affected industry, may soon be attacking agriculture. We may be on the eve of improvements in the efficiency of food production as great as those which have already taken place in mining, manufacture, and transport. In quite a few years—in our own lifetimes I mean—we may be able to perform all the operations of agriculture, mining, and manufacture with a quarter of the human effort to which we have been accustomed.\nFor the moment the very rapidity of these changes is hurting us and bringing difficult problems to solve. Those countries are suffering relatively which are not in the vanguard of progress. We are being afflicted with a new disease of which some readers may not yet have heard the name, but of which they will hear a great deal in the years to come—namely, technological unemployment. This means unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.\nBut this is only a temporary phase of maladjustment. All this means in the long run that mankind is solving its economic problem. I would predict that the standard of life in progressive countries one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as it is to-day. There would be nothing surprising in this even in the light of our present knowledge. It would not be foolish to contemplate the possibility of a far greater progress still.\n\n\nII\nLet us, for the sake of argument, suppose that a hundred years hence we are all of us, on the average, eight times better off in the economic sense than we are to-day. Assuredly there need be nothing here to surprise us.\nNow it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be insatiable. But they fall into two classes—those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not so true of the absolute needs—a point may soon be reached, much sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes.\nNow for my conclusion, which you will find, I think, to become more and more startling to the imagination the longer you think about it.\nI draw the conclusion that, assuming no important wars and no important increase in population, the economic problem may be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years. This means that the economic problem is not—if we look into the future—the permanent problem of the human race.\nWhy, you may ask, is this so startling? It is startling because—if, instead of looking into the future, we look into the past—we find that the economic problem, the struggle for subsistence, always has been hitherto the primary, most pressing problem of the human race—not only of the human race, but of the whole of the biological kingdom from the beginnings of life in its most primitive forms.\nThus we have been expressly evolved by nature—with all our impulses and deepest instincts—for the purpose of solving the economic problem. If the economic problem is solved, mankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose.\nWill this be a benefit? If one believes at all in the real values of life, the prospect at least opens up the possibility of benefit. Yet I think with dread of the readjustment of the habits and instincts of the ordinary man, bred into him for countless generations, which he may be asked to discard within a few decades.\nTo use the language of to-day—must we not expect a general “nervous breakdown”? We already have a little experience of what I mean—a nervous breakdown of the sort which is already common enough in England and the United States amongst the wives of the well-to-do classes, unfortunate women, many of them, who have been deprived by their wealth of their traditional tasks and occupations—who cannot find it sufficiently amusing, when deprived of the spur of economic necessity, to cook and clean and mend, yet are quite unable to find anything more amusing.\nTo those who sweat for their daily bread leisure is a longed-for sweet—until they get it.\nThere is the traditional epitaph written for herself by the old charwoman:—\n\nDon’t mourn for me, friends, don’t weep for me never,\nFor I’m going to do nothing for ever and ever.\n\nThis was her heaven. Like others who look forward to leisure, she conceived how nice it would be to spend her time listening-in—for there was another couplet which occurred in her poem:—\n\nWith psalms and sweet music the heavens’ll be ringing,\nBut I shall have nothing to do with the singing.\n\nYet it will only be for those who have to do with the singing that life will be tolerable—and how few of us can sing!\nThus for the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem—how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.\nThe strenuous purposeful money-makers may carry all of us along with them into the lap of economic abundance. But it will be those peoples, who can keep alive, and cultivate into a fuller perfection, the art of life itself and do not sell themselves for the means of life, who will be able to enjoy the abundance when it comes.\nYet there is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy. It is a fearful problem for the ordinary person, with no special talents, to occupy himself, especially if he no longer has roots in the soil or in custom or in the beloved conventions of a traditional society. To judge from the behaviour and the achievements of the wealthy classes to-day in any quarter of the world, the outlook is very depressing! For these are, so to speak, our advance guard—those who are spying out the promised land for the rest of us and pitching their camp there. For they have most of them failed disastrously, so it seems to me—those who have an independent income but no associations or duties or ties—to solve the problem which has been set them.\nI feel sure that with a little more experience we shall use the new-found bounty of nature quite differently from the way in which the rich use it to-day, and will map out for ourselves a plan of life quite otherwise than theirs.\nFor many ages to come the old Adam will be so strong in us that everybody will need to do some work if he is to be contented. We shall do more things for ourselves than is usual with the rich to-day, only too glad to have small duties and tasks and routines. But beyond this, we shall endeavour to spread the bread thin on the butter—to make what work there is still to be done to be as widely shared as possible. Three-hour shifts or a fifteen-hour week may put off the problem for a great while. For three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us!\nThere are changes in other spheres too which we must expect to come. When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals. We shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the pseudo-moral principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we have exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues. We shall be able to afford to dare to assess the money-motive at its true value. The love of money as a possession—as distinguished from the love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life—will be recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease. All kinds of social customs and economic practices, affecting the distribution of wealth and of economic rewards and penalties, which we now maintain at all costs, however distasteful and unjust they may be in themselves, because they are tremendously useful in promoting the accumulation of capital, we shall then be free, at last, to discard.\nOf course there will still be many people with intense, unsatisfied purposiveness who will blindly pursue wealth—unless they can find some plausible substitute. But the rest of us will no longer be under any obligation to applaud and encourage them. For we shall inquire more curiously than is safe to-day into the true character of this “purposiveness” with which in varying degrees Nature has endowed almost all of us. For purposiveness means that we are more concerned with the remote future results of our actions than with their own quality or their immediate effects on our own environment. The “purposive” man is always trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his acts by pushing his interest in them forward into time. He does not love his cat, but his cat’s kittens; nor, in truth, the kittens, but only the kittens’ kittens, and so on forward for ever to the end of cat-dom. For him jam is not jam unless it is a case of jam to-morrow and never jam to-day. Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality.\nLet me remind you of the Professor in Sylvie and Bruno:—\n\n“Only the tailor, sir, with your little bill,” said a meek voice outside the door.\n“Ah, well, I can soon settle his business,” the Professor said to the children, “if you’ll just wait a minute. How much is it, this year, my man?” The tailor had come in while he was speaking.\n“Well, it’s been a-doubling so many years, you see,” the tailor replied, a little gruffly, “and I think I’d like the money now. It’s two thousand pound, it is!”\n“Oh, that’s nothing!” the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his pocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him. “But wouldn’t you like to wait just another year and make it four thousand? Just think how rich you’d be! Why, you might be a king, if you liked!”\n“I don’t know as I’d care about being a king,” the man said thoughtfully. “But it dewsound a powerful sight o’ money! Well, I think I’ll wait——”\n“Of course you will!” said the Professor. “There’s good sense in you, I see. Good-day to you, my man!”\n“Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds?” Sylvie asked as the door closed on the departing creditor.\n“Never, my child!” the Professor replied emphatically. “He’ll go on doubling it till he dies. You see, it’s always worth while waiting another year to get twice as much money!”\n\nPerhaps it is not an accident that the race which did most to bring the promise of immortality into the heart and essence of our religions has also done most for the principle of compound interest and particularly loves this most purposive of human institutions.\nI see us free, therefore, to return to some of the most sure and certain principles of religion and traditional virtue—that avarice is a vice, that the exaction of usury is a misdemeanour, and the love of money is detestable, that those walk most truly in the paths of virtue and sane wisdom who take least thought for the morrow. We shall once more value ends above means and prefer the good to the useful. We shall honour those who can teach us how to pluck the hour and the day virtuously and well, the delightful people who are capable of taking direct enjoyment in things, the lilies of the field who toil not, neither do they spin.\nBut beware! The time for all this is not yet. For at least another hundred years we must pretend to ourselves and to every one that fair is foul and foul is fair; for foul is useful and fair is not. Avarice and usury and precaution must be our gods for a little longer still. For only they can lead us out of the tunnel of economic necessity into daylight.\nI look forward, therefore, in days not so very remote, to the greatest change which has ever occurred in the material environment of life for human beings in the aggregate. But, of course, it will all happen gradually, not as a catastrophe. Indeed, it has already begun. The course of affairs will simply be that there will be ever larger and larger classes and groups of people from whom problems of economic necessity have been practically removed. The critical difference will be realised when this condition has become so general that the nature of one’s duty to one’s neighbour is changed. For it will remain reasonable to be economically purposive for others after it has ceased to be reasonable for oneself.\nThe pace at which we can reach our destination of economic bliss will be governed by four things—our power to control population, our determination to avoid wars and civil dissensions, our willingness to entrust to science the direction of those matters which are properly the concern of science, and the rate of accumulation as fixed by the margin between our production and our consumption; of which the last will easily look after itself, given the first three.\nMeanwhile there will be no harm in making mild preparations for our destiny, in encouraging, and experimenting in, the arts of life as well as the activities of purpose.\nBut, chiefly, do not let us overestimate the importance of the economic problem, or sacrifice to its supposed necessities other matters of greater and more permanent significance. It should be a matter for specialists—like dentistry. If economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent people, on a level with dentists, that would be splendid!"

    "text": "Introductory Note\nBy David Garnett11 This paper is not so readily available online, so I’ve included it here, along with David Garnett’s introductory note.\nThe paper which follows was written as the result of a memoir of mine which was read in Lord Keynes’s absence, owing, I think, to his illness. It was afterwards sent to him to read. I am not sure of the date when my paper was read, but the envelope in which it is contained shows that it was returned by him from Tilton at the end of August 1938. His paper, which is printed here, was written at the beginning of September, when my paper was fresh in his mind. The subject of my memoir was the story of my introducing several of my friends to D. H. Lawrence, his intense dislike of them, and my bitter disappointment, which led me to stop seeing Lawrence. Keynes was one of my friends whom Lawrence most disliked. His feeling about them was, in essence, religious intolerance. He was a prophet who hated all those whose creeds protected them from ever becoming his disciples. I brought this out in my memoir and thus led Keynes to the re­ examination of his early beliefs which follows.\nI had got to know Lawrence and Frieda in 1912 owing to my father’s friendship with him.\nI was extremely fond of him and have no doubt that he liked me. I have never met a writer who appeared to have such genius. I greatly admired, and still admire, his short stories, his poems and several of his novels, particularly his first novel The White Peacock. But I was a rationalist and a scientist, and I was repelled by his intuitive and dogmatic philosophy, whereas the ideas of my friends from Cambridge interested and attracted me.\nIt was thus inevitable that sooner or later Lawrence should spew me out of his mouth, since I could never take his philo­sophy seriously. The breach was merely hastened by his meeting my friends. After my last visit to stay with Lawrence he wrote to Lady Ottoline Morrell, to whom I had also introduced him, in a letter included in his published correspondence:\n\nWe had David Garnett and Francis Birrell here for the week-end. When Bir­rell comes, tired and a bit lost and wandering-I love him. But, my God, to hear him talk sends me mad. To hear these young people talk really fills me with black fury: they talk endlessly, but endlessly-and never, never a good thing said. They are cased each in a hard little shell of his own and out of this they talk words. There is never for one second any outgoing of feeling and no reverence, not a crumb or grain of reverence. I cannot stand it. I will not have people like this-I had rather be alone. They made me dream of a beetle that bites like a scorpion. But I killed it-a very large beetle. I scotched it and it ran off-but I came on it again, and killed it. It is this horror of little swarming selves I can’t stand.\n\nOn the same day, the 19 April 1915, Lawrence wrote to me:\n\nMy dear David,\nNever bring Birrell to see me any more. There is something nasty about him like black beetles. He is horrible and unclean. I feel I should go mad when I think of your set, Duncan Grant and Keynes and Birrell. It makes me dream of beetles. In Cambridge I had a similar dream. I had felt it slightly before in the Stracheys. But it came full upon me in Keynes and in Duncan Grant. And yesterday I knew it again in Birrell ... you must leave these friends, these beetles, Birrell and Duncan Grant are done for forever. Keynes I am not sure ... when I saw Keynes that morning in Cambridge it was one of the crises of my life. It sent me mad with misery and hostility and rage ...\n\nI replied to this letter, which was really an ultimatum telling me to break with him or with my friends, as I thought suitably and I only once saw Lawrence again, by accident, on Armistice Night, the 11 November 1918, in Montague Shearman’s rooms in the Adelphi. The breach would no doubt have been healed had Lawrence been more often in England. I continued to see Frieda when she visited England periodically, and in 1928 I wrote to Lawrence to tell him how much I admired Lady Chatterley’s Lover in a letter which pleased him, and he wrote me a warm and friendly letter in return.\nThe reader is now in possession of the facts which led Maynard Keynes to re-examine his beliefs and those of his closest friends when they were undergraduates at Cambridge.\n\n\nMy Early Beliefs\nI can visualise very clearly the scene of my meeting with D. H. Lawrence in 1914 (Bunny seems to suggest 1915, but my memory suggests that it may have been earlier than that) of which he speaks in the letter from which Bunny quoted at the last meeting of the Club. But unfortunately I cannot remember any fragment of what was said, though I retain some faint remains of what was felt.\nIt was at a breakfast party given by Bertie Russell in his rooms in Nevile’s Court. There were only the three of us there. I fancy that Lawrence had been staying with Bertie and that there had been some meeting or party the night before, at which Law­ rence had been facing Cambridge. Probably he had not enjoyed it.2 My memory is that he was morose from the outset and said very little, apart from indefinite expressions of irritable dissent, all the morning. Most of the talk was between Bertie and me, and I haven’t the faintest recollection of what it was about. But it was not the sort of conversation we should have had if we had been alone. It was at Lawrence and with the intention, largely unsuccessful, of getting him to participate. We sat round the fireplace with the sofa drawn across. Law­ rence sat on the right-hand side in rather a crouching position with his head down. Bertie stood up by the fireplace, as I think I did, too, from time to time. I came away feeling that the party had been a failure and that we had failed to establish contact, but with no other particular impression. You know the sort of situation when two familiar friends talk at a visitor. I had never seen him before, and I never saw him again. Many years later he recorded in a letter, which is printed in his published correspon­dence, that I was the only member of Bloomsbury who had supported him by subscribing for Lady Chatterley.2 Professor G. E. Moore tells me that he sat next Lawrence in Hall that night and found nothing to say to him, but that afterwards Lawrence was introduced to Professor Hardy, the mathematician, with whom he had a long and friendly discussion. From the moment ofLawrence’s introduction to Hardy, the evening was a success. [D. G.]\nThat is all I remember. But Bunny’s story suggests some infer­ences to me. In the passage of his life which Bunny has described I think that Lawrence was influenced by two causes of emotional disturbance. One of them centred round Ottoline. As always, Ottoline was keeping more than one world. Except for Bertie, the Cambridge and Bloomsbury world was only just beginning to hold her. Lawrence, Gertler, Carrington were a different strand in her furbelows. Lawrence was jealous of the other lot; and Cambridge rationalism and cynicism, then at their height, were, of course, repulsive to him. Bertie gave him what must have been, I think, his first glimpse of Cambridge. It over­ whelmed, attracted and repulsed him-which was the other emotional disturbance. It was obviously a civilisation, and not less obviously uncomfortable and unattainable for him-very repulsive and very attractive. Now Bunny had come into his life quite independently, neither through Ottoline nor from Cam­ bridge and Bloomsbury; he was evidently very fond of Bunny; and when he saw him being seduced by Cambridge, he was yet more jealous, just as he was jealous of Ottoline’s new leanings that way. And jealousy apart, it is impossible to imagine moods more antagonistic than those of Lawrence and of pre-war Cambridge.\nBut when all that has been said, was there something true and right in what Lawrence felt? There generally was. His reactions were incomplete and unfair, but they were not usually baseless. I have said that I have forgotten what the conversation was about. But I expect it was pretty brittle stuff-not so brittle as Frankie Birrell’s-but pretty brittle all the same. And although it was silly to take it, or to estimate it, at its face value, did the way of responding to life which lay behind it lack something important? Lawrence was oblivious of anything valuable it may have offered-it was a lack that he was violently apprehending. So Bunny’s memoir has thrown my mind back to reflections about our mental history in the dozen years before the war; and if it will not shock the club too much, I should like in this contribution to its proceedings to introduce for once, mental or spiritual, instead of sexual, adventures, to try and recall the principal impacts on one’s virgin mind and to wonder how it has all turned out, and whether one still holds by that youthful religion.\nI went up to Cambridge at Michaelmas 1902, and Moore’s Principia Ethica came out at the end of my first year. I have never heard of the present generation having read it. But, of course, its effect on us, and the talk which preceded and followed it, dominated, and perhaps still dominate, everything else. We were at an age when our beliefs influenced our behaviour, a characteristic of the young which it is easy for the middle-aged to forget, and the habits of feeling formed then still persist in a recognisable degree. It is those habits of feeling, influencing the majority of us, which make this Club a collectivity and separate us from the rest. They overlaid, somehow, our otherwise extremely different characters-Moore himself was a puritan and precisian, Strachey (for that was his name at that time) a Voltairean, Woolf a rabbi, myself a non-conformist, Sheppard a conformist and (as it now turns out) an ecclesiastic, Clive a gay and amiable dog, Sydney-Turner a quietist, Hawtrey a dogmatist and so on. Of those who had come just before, only MacCarthy and Ainsworth, who were much influenced by their personal feelings for Moore, came under his full influence. We did not see much of Forster at that time; who was already the elusive colt of a dark horse. It was only for us, those who were active in 1903, that Moore completely ousted McTaggart, Dickinson, Russell. The influence was not only overwhelming; but it was the extreme opposite of what Strachey used to call funeste; it was exciting, exhilarating, the beginning of a renaissance, the opening of a new heaven on a new earth, we were the forerunners of a new dispensation, we were not afraid of anything. Perhaps it was because we were so brought up that even at our gloomiest and worst we have never lost a certain resilience which the younger generation seem never to have had. They have enjoyed, at most, only a pale reflection of something, not altogether superseded, but faded and without illusions.\nNow what we got from Moore was by no means entirely what he offered us. He had one foot on the threshold of the new heaven, but the other foot in Sidgwick and the Benthamite calculus and the general rules of correct behaviour. There was one chapter in the Principia of which we took not the slightest notice. We accepted Moore’s religion, so to speak, and discarded his morals. Indeed, in our opinion, one of the greatest advantages of his religion, was that it made morals unnecessary-meaning by ‘religion’ one’s attitude towards oneself and the ultimate and by ‘morals’ one’s attitude towards the outside world and the inter­ mediate. To the consequences of having a religion and no morals I return later.\nEven if the new members of the Club know what the religion was (do they?), it will not do any of us any harm to try and recall the crude outlines. Nothing mattered except states of mind, our own and other people’s of course, but chiefly our own. These states of mind were not associated with action or achievement or with consequences. They consisted in timeless, passionate states of contemplation and communion, largely unattached to ‘before’ and ‘after’. Their value depended, in accordance with the prin­ ciple of organic unity, on the state of affairs as a whole which could not be usefully analysed into parts. For example, the value of the state of mind of being in love did not depend merely on the nature of one’s own emotions, but also on the worth of their object and on the reciprocity and nature of the object’s emotions; but it did not depend, if I remember rightly, or did not depend much, on what happened, or how one felt about it, a year later, though I myself was always an advocate of a principle of organic unity through time, which still seems to me only sensible. The appropriate subjects of passionate contemplation and communion were a beloved person, beauty and truth, and one’s prime objects in life were love, the creation and enjoyment of aesthetic ex­ perience and the pursuit of knowledge. Of these love came a long way first. But in the early days under Moore’s influence the public treatment of this and its associated acts was, on the whole, austere and platonic. Some of us might argue that physical enjoyment could spoil and detract from the state of mind as a whole. I do not remember at what date Strachey issued his edict that certain Latin technical terms of sex were the correct words to use, that to avoid them was a grave error, and, even in mixed company, a weakness, and the use of other synonyms a vulgarity. But I should certainly say that this was later. In 1903 those words were not even esoteric terms of common discourse.\nOur religion closely followed the English puritan tradition of being chiefly concerned with the salvation of our own souls. The divine resided within a closed circle. There was not a very inti­ mate connection between ‘being good’ and ‘doing good’; and we had a feeling that there was some risk that in practice the latter might interfere with the former. But religions proper, as distinct from modern ‘social service’ pseudo-religions, have al­ ways been of that character; and perhaps it was a sufficient offset that our religion was altogether unworldly-with wealth, power, popularity or success it had no concern whatever, they were thoroughly despised.\nHow did we know what states of mind were good? This was a matter of direct inspection, of direct unanalysable intuition about which it was useless and impossible to argue. In that case who was right when there was a difference of opinion? There were two possible explanations. It might be that the two parties were not really talking about the same thing, that they were not bring­ ing their intuitions to bear on precisely the same object, and, by virtue of the principle of organic unity, a very small difference in the object might make a very big difference in the result. Or it might be that some people had an acuter sense of judgment, just as some people can judge a vintage port and others cannot. On the whole, so far as I remember, this explanation prevailed. In practice, victory was with those who could speak with the greatest appearance of clear, undoubting conviction and could best use the accents of infallibility. Moore at this time was a master of this method-greeting one’s remarks with a gasp of incredulity­ Do you really think that, an expression of face as if to hear such a thing said reduced him to a state of wonder verging on imbecility, with his mouth wide open and wagging his head in the negative so violently that his hair shook. Oh! he would say, goggling at you as if either you or he must be mad; and no reply was possible. Strachey’s methods were different: grim silence as if such a dreadful observation was beyond comment and the less said about it the better, but almost as effective for disposing of what he called death-packets. Woolf was fairly good at indicating a negative, but he was better at producing the effect that was use­ less to argue with him than at crushing you. Dickinson knew how to shrug his shoulders and retreat unconvinced, but it was retreat all the same. As for Sheppard and me we could only turn like worms, but worms who could be eventually goaded into voluble claims that worms have at least the right to turn. Yet after all the differences were about details. Broadly speaking we all knew for certain what were good states of mind and that they consisted in communion with objects of love, beauty and truth.\nI have called this faith a religion, and some sort of relation of neo-platonism it surely was. But we should have been very angry at the time with such a suggestion. We regarded all this as en­tirely rational and scientific in character. Like any other branch of science, it was nothing more than the application of logic and rational analysis to the material presented as sense-data. Our apprehension of good was exactly the same as our apprehension of green, and we purported to handle it with the same logical and analytical technique which was appropriate to the latter. Indeed we combined a dogmatic treatment as to the nature of experience with a method of handling it which was extravagantly scholastic. Russell’s Principles of Mathematics came out in the same year as Principia Ethica; and the former, in spirit, furnished a method for handling the material provided by the latter. Let me give you a few examples of the sort of things we used to discuss.\nIf A was in love with B and believed that B reciprocated his feelings, whereas in fact B did not, but was in love with C, the state of affairs was certainly not so good as it would have been if A had been right, but was it worse or better than it would become if A discovered his mistake? If A was in love with B under a misapprehension as to B’s qualities, was this better or worse than A’s not being in love at all? If A was in love with B because A’s spectacles were not strong enough to see B’s complexion, did this altogether, or partly, destroy the value of A’s state of mind? Suppose we were to live our lives backwards, having our experiences in the reverse order, would this affect the value of suc­cessive states of mind? If the states of mind enjoyed by each of us were pooled and then redistributed, would this affect their value? How did one compare the value of a good state of mind which had bad consequences with a bad state of mind which had good consequences? In valuing the consequences did one assess them at their actual value as it turned out eventually to be, or their probable value at the time? If at their probable value, how much evidence as to possible consequences was it one’s duty to collect before applying the calculus? Was there a separate objec­tive standard of beauty? Was a beautiful thing, that is to say, by definition that which it was good to contemplate? Or was there an actual objective quality’ beauty’, just like’ green’ and’ good’? And knowledge, too, presented a problem. Were all truths equally good to pursue and contemplate?-as for example the number of grains in a given tract of sea-sand. We were disposed to re­pudiate very strongly the idea that useful knowledge could be preferable to useless knowledge. But we flirted with the idea that there might be some intrinsic quality-though not, perhaps, quite on a par with ‘green’ and ‘good’ and ‘beautiful’-which once could call ‘interesting’, and we were prepared to think it just possible that ‘interesting’ knowledge might be better to pursue than ‘uninteresting’  knowledge.  Another competing adjective was ‘important’, provided it was quite clear that ‘im­portant’ did not mean ‘useful’. Or to return again to our favourite subject, was a violent love affair which lasted a short time better than a more tepid one which endured longer? We were inclined to think it was. But I have said enough by now to make it clear that the problems of mensuration, in which we had involved ourselves, were somewhat formidable.\nIt was all under the influence of Moore’s method, according to which you could hope to make essentially vague notions clear by using precise language about them and asking exact questions. It was a method of discovery by the instrument of impeccable grammar and an unambiguous dictionary. ‘What exactly do you mean?’ was the phrase most frequently on our lips. If it appeared under cross-examination that you did not mean exactly anything, you lay under a strong suspicion of meaning nothing whatever. It was a stringent education in dialectic; but in practice it was a kind of combat in which strength of character was really much more valuable than subtlety of mind. In the preface to his great work, bespattered with the numerous italics through which the reader who knew him could actually hear, as with Queen Victoria, the vehemence of his utterance, Moore begins by saying that error is chiefly ‘the attempt to answer questions, without first discovering precisely what question it is which you desire to answer ... Once we recognise the exact meaning of the two questions, I think it also becomes plain exactly what kind of reasons are relevant as arguments for or against any particular answer to them.’ So we spent our time trying to discover precisely what questions we were asking, confident in the faith that, if only we could ask precise questions, everyone would know the answer. Indeed Moore expressly claimed as much. In his famous chapter on ‘The Ideal’ he wrote:\n\nIndeed, once the meaning of the question is clearly understood, the answer to it, in its main outlines, appears to be so obvious, that it runs the risk of seeming to be a platitude. By far the most valuable things, which we know or can imagine, are certain states of consciousness, which may be roughly described as the pleasures of human intercourse and the enjoyment of beautiful objects. No one, probably, who has asked himself the question, has ever doubted that personal affection and the appreciation of what is beautiful in Art or Nature, are good in themselves; nor if we consider strictly what things are worth having purely for their own sakes, does it appear probable that any one will think that anything else has nearly so great a value as the things which are included under these two heads.\n\nAnd then there was the question of pleasure. As time wore on towards the nineteen-tens, I fancy we weakened a bit about plea­sure. But, in our prime, pleasure was nowhere. I would faintly urge that if two states of mind were similar in all other respects except that one was pleasurable and the other was painful there might be a little to be said for the former, but the principle of organic unities was against me. It was the general view (though not quite borne out by the Principia) that pleasure had nothing to do with the case and, on the whole, a pleasant state of mind lay under grave suspicion of lacking intensity and passion.\nIn those days X had not taken up women, nor Woolf monkeys, and they were not their present blithe selves. The two of them, sunk deep in silence and in basket chairs on opposite sides of the fireplace in a room which was at all times pitch dark, would stop sucking their pipes only to murmur that all good states of mind were extremely painful and to imply that all painful states of mind were extremely good. Strachey seconded them-it was only in his second childhood that Lytton took up pleasure­ though his sorrow was more fitful than their settled gloom. But with Sheppard and myself cheerfulness could not but break through, and we were in great disgrace about it. There was a terrible scene one evening when we turned insubordinate and reckless and maintained that there was nothing wrong in itself in being cheerful. It was decided that such low habits were parti­cularly characteristic of King’s as opposed to the austerity of Trinity.\nSocrates had persuaded Protarchus that pure hedonism was absurd. Moore himself was only prepared to accept pleasure as enhancement of a state of affairs otherwise good. But Moore hated evil and he found a place in his religion for vindictive punishment. ‘Not only is the pleasantness of a state not in pro­ portion to its intrinsic worth; it may even add positively to its vileness ... The infliction of pain on a person whose state of mind is bad may, if the pain be not too intense, create a state of things that is better on the whole than if the evil state of mind had existed unpunished. Whether such a state of affairs can ever constitute a positive good is another question.’ I call attention to the quali­fication ‘if the pain be not too intense’. Our Ideal was a merciful God.\nThus we were brought up-with Plato’s absorption in the good in itself, with a scholasticism which outdid St Thomas, in cal­vinistic withdrawal from the pleasures and successes of Vanity Fair, and oppressed with all the sorrows of Werther. It did not prevent us from laughing most of the time and we enjoyed supreme self-confidence, superiority and contempt towards all the rest of the unconverted world. But it was hardly a state of mind which a grown-up person in his senses could sustain literally. When MacCarthy came down for a week-end, he would smile affectionately, persuade Moore to sing his German Lieder at the piano, to hear which we all agreed was a very good state of mind indeed, or incite Bob Trevy to deliver a broken oration which was a frantic travesty of the whole method, the charm of it lying in the impossibility of deciding whether Bob himself meant it, half at least, seriously or not.\nIt seems to me looking back, that this religion of ours was a very good one to grow up under. It remains nearer the truth than any other that I know, with less irrelevant extraneous matter and nothing to be ashamed of; though it is a comfort to-day to be able to discard with a good conscience the calculus and the mensura­tion and the duty to know exactly what one means and feels. It was a purer, sweeter air by far than Freud cum Marx. It is still my religion under the surface. I read again last week Moore’s famous chapter on ‘The Ideal’. It is remarkable how wholly oblivious he managed to be of the qualities of the life of action and also of the pattern of life as a whole. He was existing in a timeless ecstasy. His way of translating his own particular emotions of the moment into the language of generalised abstraction is a charm­ing and beautiful comedy. Do you remember the passage in which he discusses whether, granting that it is mental qualities which one should chiefly love, it is important that the beloved person should also be good-looking? In the upshot good looks win a modest victory over ‘mental qualities’. I cannot forbear to quote this sweet and lovely passage, so sincere and passionate and careful:\n\nI think it may be admitted that wherever the affection is most valuable, the appreciation of mental qualities must form a large part of it, and that the presence of this part makes the whole far more valuable than it could have been without it. But it seems very doubtful whether this appreciation, by itself, can possess as much value as the whole in which it is combined with an appreciation of the appropriate corporeal expression of the mental qualities in question. It is certain that in all actual cases of valuable affection, the bodily expressions of character, whether by looks, by words, or by actions, do form a part of the object towards which the affection is felt, and that the fact of their inclusion appears to heighten the value of the whole state. It is, indeed, very difficult to imagine what the cognition of mental qualities alone, unaccompanied by any corporeal expression, would be like; and, in so far as we succeed in making this abstraction, the whole considered certainly appears to have less value. I therefore conclude that the importance of an admiration of admirable mental qualities lies chiefly in the immense superiority of a whole, in which it forms a part, to one in which it is absent, and not in any high degree of intrinsic value which it possesses by itself. It even appears to be doubtful whether, in itself, it possesses so much value as the appreciation of mere corporeal beauty undoubtedly does possess; that is to say, whether the appre­ciation of what has great intrinsic value is so valuable as the appreciation of what is merely beautiful.\nBut further if we consider the nature of admirable mental qualities, by themselves, it appears that a proper appreciation of them involves a reference to purely material beauty in yet another way. Admirable mental qualities do, if our previous conclusions are correct, consist very largely in an emotional contemplation of beautiful objects; and hence the appreciation of them will consist essentially in the contemplation of such contemplation. It is true that the most valuable appreciation of persons appears to be that which consists in the appreciation of their appreciation of other persons: but even here a reference to material beauty appears to be involved, both in respect of the fact that what is appreciated in the last instance may be the contemplation of what is merely beautiful, and in respect of the fact that the most valuable appreciation of a person appears to include an appreciation of his corporeal expression. Though, therefore, we may admit that the appreciation of a person’s attitude towards other persons, or, to take one instance, the love of love, is far the most valuable good we know, and far more valuable than the mere love of beauty, yet we can only admit this if the first be understood to include the latter, in various degrees of directness.\n\nThe New Testament is a handbook for politicians compared with the unworldliness of Moore’s chapter on ‘The Ideal’. I know no equal to it in literature since Plato. And it is better than Plato because it is quite free from fancy. It conveys the beauty of the literalness of Moore’s mind, the pure and passionate intensity of his vision, unfanciful and undressed-up. Moore had a night­ mare once in which he could not distinguish propositions from tables. But even when he was awake, he could not distinguish love and beauty and truth from the furniture. They took on the same definition of outline, the same stable, solid, objective quali­ ties and common-sense reality.\nI see no reason to shift from the fundamental intuitions of Principia Ethica; though they are much too few and too narrow to fit actual experience which provides a richer and more various content. That they furnish a justification of experience wholly independent of outside events had become an added comfort, even though one cannot live today secure in the undisturbed individualism which was the extraordinary achievement of the early Edwardian days, not for our little lot only, but for everyone else, too.\nI am still a long way off from D. H. Lawrence and what he might have been justified in meaning when he said that we were ‘done for’. And even now I am not quite ready to approach that theme. First of all I must explain the other facet of our faith. So far it has been a question of our attitude to ourselves and one another. What was our understanding of the outside world and our relation to it?\nIt was an important object of Moore’s book to distinguish between goodness as an attribute of states of mind and rightness as an attribute of actions. He also has a section on the justification of general rules of conduct. The large part played by considera­tions of probability in his theory of right conduct was, indeed, an important contributory cause to my spending all the leisure of many years on the study of that subject: I was writing under the joint influence of Moore’s Principia Ethica and Russell’s Principia Mathematica. But for the most part, as I have said, we did not pay attention to this aspect of the book or bother much about it. We were living in the specious present, nor had begun to play the game of consequences. We existed in the world of Plato’s Dialogues; we had not reached the Republic, let alone the Laws. This brought us one big advantage. As we had thrown hedon­ism out of the window and, discarding Moore’s so highly prob­lematical calculus, lived entirely in present experience, since social action as an end in itself and not merely as a lugubrious duty had dropped out of our Ideal, and not only social action, but the life of action generally, power, politics, success, wealth, ambition, with the economic motive and the economic criterion less prominent in our philosophy than with St Francis of Assisi, who at least made collections for the birds, it follows that we were amongst the first of our generation, perhaps alone amongst our generation, to escape from the Benthamite tradition. In practice, of course, at least so far as I was concerned, the outside world was not forgotten or forsworn. But I am recalling what our Ideal was in those early days when the life of passionate contem­plation and communion was supposed to oust all other purposes whatever. It can be no part of this memoir for me to try to explain why it was such a big advantage for us to have escaped from the Benthamite tradition. But I do now regard that as the worm which has been gnawing at the insides of modern civilisation and is responsible for its present moral decay. We used to regard the Christians as the enemy, because they appeared as the representa­tives of tradition, convention and hocus-pocus. In truth it was the Benthamite calculus, based on an over-valuation of the economic criterion, which was destroying the quality of the popular Ideal. Moreover, it was this escape from Bentham, joined with the unsurpassable individualism of our philosophy, which has served to protect the whole lot of us from the final reductio ad absurdum of Benthamism known as Marxism. We have completely failed, indeed, to provide a substitute for these economic bogus-faiths capable of protecting or satisfying our successors. But we our­ selves have remained-am I not right in saying all of us?­ altogether immune from the virus, as safe in the citadel of our ultimate faith as the Pope of Rome in his.\nThis is what we gained. But we set on one side, not only that part of Moore’s fifth chapter on ‘Ethics in relation to Conduct’ which dealt with the obligation so to act as to produce by causal connection the most probable maximum of eventual good through the whole procession of future ages (a discussion which was in­deed riddled with fallacies), but also the part which discussed the duty of the individual to obey general rules. We entirely repudi­ated a personal liability on us to obey general rules. We claimed the right to judge every individual case on its merits, and the wisdom, experience and self-control to do so successfully. This was a very important part of our faith, violently and aggressively held, and for the outer world it was our most obvious and danger­ous characteristic. We repudiated entirely customary morals, conventions and traditional wisdom. We were, that is to say, in the strict sense of the term, immoralists. The consequences of being found out had, of course, to be considered for what they were worth. But we recognised no moral obligation on us, no inner sanction, to conform or to obey. Before heaven we claimed to be our own judge in our own case. I have come to think that this is, perhaps, rather a Russian characteristic. It is certainly not an English one. It resulted in a general, widespread, though partly covert, suspicion affecting ourselves, our motives and our behaviour. This suspicion still persists to a certain extent, and it always will. It has deeply coloured the course of our lives in relation to the outside world. It is, I now think, a justifiable suspicion. Yet so far as I am concerned, it is too late to change. I remain, and always will remain, an immoralist.\nI am not now concerned, however, with the fact that this aspect of our code was shocking. It would have been not less so, even if we had been perfectly right. What matters a great deal more is the fact that it was flimsily based, as I now think, on an a priori view of what human nature is like, both other people’s and our own, which was disastrously mistaken.\nI have said that we were amongst the first to escape from Benthamism. But of another eighteenth-century heresy we were the unrepentant heirs and last upholders. We were among the last of the Utopians, or meliorists as they are sometimes called, who believe in a continuing moral progress by virtue of which the human race already consists of reliable, rational, decent people, influenced by truth and objective standards, who can be safely released from the outward restraints of convention and traditional standards and inflexible rules of conduct, and left, from now onwards, to their own sensible devices, pure motives and reliable intuitions of the good. The view that human nature is reasonable had in 1903 quite a long history behind it. It underlay the ethics of self-interest-rational self-interest as it was called­ just as much as the universal ethics of Kant or Bentham which aimed at the general good; and it was because self-interest was rational that the egoistic and altruistic systems were supposed to work out in practice to the same conclusions.\nIn short, we repudiated all versions of the doctrine of original sin, of there being insane and irrational springs of wickedness in most men. We were not aware that civilisation was a thin and pre­carious crust erected by the personality and the will of a very few, and only maintained by rules and conventions skilfully put across and guilefully preserved. We had no respect for traditional wisdom or the restraints of custom. We lacked reverence, as Lawrence observed and as Ludwig with justice also used to say­ for everything and everyone. It did not occur to us to respect the extraordinary accomplishment of our predecessors in the ordering of life (as it now seems to me to have been) or the elaborate framework which they had devised to protect this order. Plato said in his Laws that one of the best of a set of good laws would be a law forbidding any young man to enquire which of them are right or wrong, though an old man remarking any defect in the laws might communicate this observation to a ruler or to an equal in years when no young man was present. That was a dictum in which we should have been unable to discover any point or significance whatever. As cause and consequence of our general state of mind we completely misunderstood human nature, including our own. The rationality which we attributed to it led to a superficiality, not only of judgment, but also of feeling. It was not only that intellectually we were pre-Freudian, but we had lost something which our predecessors had without replacing it. I still suffer incurably from attributing an unreal rationality to other people’s feelings and behaviour (and doubt­ less to my own, too). There is one small but extraordinarily silly manifestation of this absurd idea of what is ‘normal’, namely the impulse to protest-to write a letter to The Times, call a meeting in the Guildhall, subscribe to some fund when my presuppositions as to what is ‘normal’ are not fulfilled. I behave as if there really existed some authority or standard to which I can successfully appeal if I shout loud enough-perhaps it is some hereditary vestige of a belief in the efficacy of prayer.\nI have said that this pseudo-rational view of human nature led to a thinness, a superficiality, not only of judgment, but also of feeling. It seems to me that Moore’s chapter on ‘The Ideal’ left out altogether some whole categories of valuable emotion. The attribution of rationality to human nature, instead of enriching it, now seems to me to have impoverished it. It ignored certain powerful and valuable springs of feeling. Some of the spon­taneous, irrational outbursts of human nature can have a sort of value from which our schematism was cut off. Even some of the feelings associated with wickedness can have value. And in addition to the values arising out of spontaneous, volcanic and even wicked impulses, there are many objects of valuable con­templation and communion beyond those we knew of-those concerned with the order and pattern of life amongst communi­ties and the emotions which they can inspire. Though one must ever remember Paley’s dictum that ’although we speak of com­munities as of sentient beings and ascribe to them happiness and misery, desires, interests and passions, nothing really exists or feels but individuals’, yet we carried the individualism of our individuals too far.\nAnd as the years wore on towards 1914, the thinness and super­ficiality, as well as the falsity, of our view of man’s heart became, as it now seems to me, more obvious; and there was, too, some falling away from the purity of the original doctrine. Concentration on moments of communion between a pair of lovers got thoroughly mixed up with the, once rejected, pleasure. The pat­tern of life would sometimes become no better than a succession of permutations of short sharp superficial ‘intrigues’, as we called them. Our comments on life and affairs were bright and amusing, but brittle-as I said of the conversation of Russell and myself with Lawrence-because there was no solid diagnosis of human nature underlying them. Bertie in particular sustained simultaneously a pair of opinions ludicrously incompatible. He held that in fact human affairs were carried on after a most irrational fashion, but that the remedy was quite simple and easy, since all we had to do was to carry them on rationally. A discussion of practical affairs on these lines was really very boring. And a discussion of the human heart which ignored so many of its deeper and blinder passions, both good and bad, was scarcely more interesting. Indeed it is only states of mind that matter, provided we agree to take account of the pattern of life through time and give up regarding it as a series of independent, instan­taneous flashes, but the ways in which states of mind can be valuable, and the objects of them, are more various, and also much richer, than we allowed for. I fancy we used in old days to get round the rich variety of experience by expanding illegiti­mately the field of aesthetic appreciation (we would deal, for example, with all branches of the tragic emotion under this head), classifying as aesthetic experience what is really human experience and somehow sterilising it by this mis-classification.\nIf, therefore, I altogether ignore our merits-our charm, our intelligence, our unworldliness, our affection-I can see us as water-spiders, gracefully skimming, as light and reasonable as air, the surface of the stream without any contact at all with the eddies and currents underneath. And if I imagine us as coming under the observation of Lawrence’s ignorant, jealous, irritable, hostile eyes, what a combination of qualities we offered to arouse his passionate distaste; this thin rationalism skipping on the crust of the lava, ignoring both the reality and the value of the vulgar passions, joined to libertinism and comprehensive irreverence, too clever by half for such an earthy character as Bunny, seducing with its intellectual chic such a portent as Ottoline, a regular skin-poison. All this was very unfair to poor, silly, well-meaning us. But that is why I say that there may have been just a grain of truth when Lawrence said in 1914 that we were ‘done for’."

Be sure to cite work that you use, both direct quotations and paraphrased ideas. Any citation method that is tolerably clear is permitted, but if you’d like a good description of a citation scheme that works well in philosophy, look at http://bit.ly/VDhRJ4.\nYou are encouraged to discuss the course material, including assignments, with your classmates, but all written work that you hand in under your own name must be your own. If work is handed is as the work of two people, you are affirming that each person did a fair share of the work. (Note that when you’re submitting work on Canvas, you have to each submit the paper, even if it is co-authored. That way Canvas knows that everyone has turned in work.)\nYou should also be familiar with the academic integrity policies of the College of Literature, Science & the Arts at the University of Michigan, which are available here: http://www.lsa.umich.edu/academicintegrity/. Violations of these policies will be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for Student Academic Affairs, and sanctioned with a course grade of F."
