<p>In the late 19th century, if you were a Cambridge student interested in philosophy very broadly construed, the degree you took was called Moral Sciences. It was officially called the Moral Sciences Tripos, but exactly what a Tripos is, and why it was called that, don’t matter that much to our story. What matters is that it was a three year degree, and it was centred around examinations at the end of the second and third year.</p>
<p>Note that this is in England, so it’s the English university system. And that’s a bit different to what you might be used to in America, Australia, Canada, Scotland, or elsewhere in the English speaking world. In England, in Keynes’s time as now, undergraduates take all their courses in the subject they are taking their degree in. I think this is part of the appeal of degrees like PPE in England; it means that students aren’t quite so concentrated. But it also means that just the sheer number of courses means that most students take a lot of courses in almost every sub-discipline of their degree. Relatedly, students in Moral Sciences were expected to complete a common exam, which covered the whole of the discipline.</p>
<p>And what was the discipline of moral sciences? The best guide I’ve found is an 1891 [student’s guide to the University of Cambridge], which includes a lot of advice for students taking Moral Sciences. That’s a little hard to read, but thankfully Irwin Collier, who has a <a href="https://www.irwincollier.com/">fantastic site on archival artifacts from the history of economics</a> has made an <a href="https://www.irwincollier.com/cambridge-on-the-moral-sciences-tripos-james-ward-editor-1891/">HTML version of the Moral Sciences part</a>. He notes that Keynes, i.e., John <strong>Neville</strong> Keynes, contributed to the part of the guide on political economy. The guide describes in some detail what students should know for the two big exams, with this being the important overview.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The examination for the Moral Sciences Tripos consists of two parts; and begins, as a rule, upon the Monday after the last Sunday but one in May. No student may present himself for both parts in the same year. The first part consists of two papers on each of the following subjects: Psychology including Ethical Psychology; Logic and Methodology; Political Economy; together with a paper of Essays. …</p>
<p>The subjects of the second part of the examination fall into two groups:–(A) Metaphysics, Political Philosophy, Ethics–on each of which there is one paper–and (B) the following special subjects, History of Philosophy, Advanced Logic and Methodology, Advanced Psychology and Psychophysics, Advanced Political Economy. There are two papers on each of these special subjects besides an Essay paper containing questions on all the above subjects. Every student must take one, and may not take more than two, of the special subjects; also every student must take the papers on Metaphysics and Ethics except those who select Advanced Political Economy as a special subject: for such students the paper on Political Philosophy is provided as an alternative for Metaphysics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that’s what you had to do: psychology (including what we’d now call moral psychology), logic, politics/economics, and then in senior year, metaphysics (though you can opt out of that), political philosophy, ethics, history of philosophy, and advanced versions of the earlier material. Metaphysics, by the way, means largely what we’d call epistemology. The first topic is “Knowledge, its analysis and general characteristics: material and formal elements of knowledge; self-consciousness as unifying principle; uniformity and continuity of experience.”, and there are several more about certainty, coordination (social epistemology!), and others. Again, you can follow the links to see the details in what the parts that would now be considered philosophy consist in.</p>
<p>The economics and psychology parts are shot through with names that we’d consider philosophers. The economics section lists (John Stuart) Mill, Sidgwick, Jevons, (John Neville) Keynes, and, of course, Smith. The psychology section has Dewey and James as the most important figures. If you think about contemporary philosophy departments, this shouldn’t be a surprise. It’s natural that people in philosophy, as it is construed at a time, will know a lot about philosophy, as it is construed at that time. And at the time, philosophy included pretty much all of what we’d now call Cognitive Science, and pretty much all of what we’d now call PPE. (Michigan Philosophy is, in this respect, trying to return philosophy to its former glory.)</p>
<p>But a lot changed in 1903. It was a big year for Cambridge Moral Sciences. Moore published <em>Principia Ethica</em>, a book we’ll talk a lot about in this course. Russell published <em>The Principles of Mathematics</em>, which we won’t talk about at all after this sentence. And a campaign led by Alfred Marshall, but opposed by many others, finally succeeded in breaking off Economics from Moral Sciences, and creating its own tripos (i.e., degree).</p>
<p>This didn’t affect Maynard Keynes directly; he was a mathematics undergraduate. But it had a massive effect on his overall life. For one thing, it complicated his father’s position; when the split happened he naturally went into Economics, but it probably led to him doing less philosophical work than he otherwise might have. (Remember he had written the most important logic book of the years immediately preceding Frege and Russell.) But it also led to complications for Maynard’s position. He had obvious leanings towards economics, not least because he wanted to work in Treasury. But he also wanted to work on, for related reasons, Moorean ethics, and the foundations of probability. All of this would have been easier in the old Moral Sciences program than it was in the world that was created by the split. We shouldn’t overstate this - interaction between departments at Cambridge has always been very strong compared to other places, and it certainly didn’t stop Keynes talking with Russell about probability, or Edgeworth publishing on probability in <em>Mind</em>. And Keynes spent a lot of time (really, a lot of time) with Wittgenstein, so it wasn’t like he was out of the loop in philosophy. Still, I can’t help wonder what his career would have looked like had it been spent entirely in a department centred around philosophy.</p>
<p>I’m going over this all at some length in part because it is so important to Keynes’s intellectual background, but in part because it seems more important to the history of analytic philosophy than is usually accounted for. I don’t know how much it comes up these days, but until circa 2010, the standard introductory course in a US analytic philosophy program (the pro-sem) was typically a course on the foundations of analytic philosophy, with a special focus on Frege, Russell, and (early) Wittgenstein. You saw variations on this theme, maybe some Moore here, some late Wittgenstein there, often some Kripke to make it more contemporary, but that was the basic idea. And so much of that story is taking place at Cambridge, in this middle of which the department these folks are in goes through this big split.</p>
<p>One thing you might notice from that list of names is that, with the partial exception of Moore, there isn’t much ethics there, and no political philosophy. (And it’s Moore’s meta-ethics, or his metaphysics and epistemology, that were covered in these courses, not his normative ethics. Of course Russell had a lot to say about politics, and political philosophy, but that’s not read much in contemporary philosophy.) Given how central Sidgwick was to the previous generation of Cambridge philosophers, that’s something of a surprise. I really don’t have the evidence for this, but it’s a speculation. One thing that I’ve seen after the few department splits I know about (Sydney in the 1960s, Irvine more recently) is that subjects that are sort of between the specialisations of the new department get a little left out. It’s more common to see neither department do them than to see both. I wonder how much losing political economy meant that the remaining philosophers thought that political philosophy wasn’t part of their jurisdiction any more, and/or that the people who might have been the Cambridge moral and political philosophers of the early 20th century simply moved departments in the split. As I said, I don’t really know if this is even a viable theory, but I think the split is an important and under-discussed part of a really significant moment in the history of philosophy.</p>
