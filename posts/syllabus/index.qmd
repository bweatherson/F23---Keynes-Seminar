# Course Description

This course is about the philosophical work of John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946). The largest part of the course will be on his book on probability, but we'll also look at the philosophical aspects of his economic work (including the question of whether his work on probability was important in it), the relevance of his work to social metaphysics, and to moral philosophy, and his place in the history of philosophy, both as a subject and as a historian.

# Required Materials

You don't have to buy anything for the course. Most of Keynes's works are in the public domain (at least in some country), and the rest will be made available either through this site or through Canvas.

If you want to buy one thing as background reading, I'd recommend Robert Skidelsky's biography of Keynes. It's not trivial to get the full three-volume version in the United States, but the [single volume](https://bookshop.org/p/books/john-maynard-keynes-1883-1946-economist-philosopher-statesman-robert-skidelsky/11691099?ean=9780143036159) is a tolerable substitute.

# Course Requirements

1.  Participate in the classes each week, having done the reading.
2.  Write three 'weeklies' at some point during the term. A weekly should be a 750-ish word paper making one good point (either a criticism, or an application to some other debate) about the reading for that week. These should not be summaries of the text; assume the reader knows what you're talking about.
3.  In every week that you don't write a weekly, leave (at least) one question about (at least) one of the papers from the reading on the Canvas discussion boards.
4.  When possible, answer some of the questions on the boards, and contribute to discussions there.
5.  Write one short paper (about 10-12 pages, or about 3000 words) on one of the topics we discuss in the course.

The weeklies, and the short paper, may be co-authored. (I don't know what it would be to co-author a question, though you should give credit to someone if the question came out of discussions with them.)

# Summary of Grading System

1.  Participation in discussion boards and online classes - 20%
2.  Weeklies - 3 by 10% = 30%
3.  Short paper - 50%

# Class Schedule

The links to readings will often be to things behind paywalls, but they are (I believe) all things you have access to through the UM library. You might have to be logged in to UM to get them though.

For each week, we'll go through the readings in the order they are here. That doesn't mean they are in order of importance; a couple of times there is a reading I want to focus on, but we need to briefly discuss something else to set it up. So each week I've starred the one that is really most crucial, though it might not be stuff we start with. Also, we'll open each week with an open floor for any questions/comments/etc about anything on the list. After that I'll work through things in the order they appear here, with the intent of going in the order shown.

It might not be obvious, but many of the paper titles below contain links to places the paper is accessible. (In some cases, that includes places where I have made them accessible, mostly legally.)

Note that because we really aren't expecting everyone to do the recommended reading, if you want to make a point about something in the recommended reading, you might need to provide a bit of background to any comment. (This isn't important for the discussion boards, but it is important in class.) But you should assume everyone is familiar with the required readings, especially the starred ones.

# Other Information

## Canvas

There is a Canvas site for this course, which can be accessed from <https://canvas.umich.edu>. Course documents (syllabus, lecture notes, assignments) will be available from this site. Please make sure that you can access this site. Consult the site regularly for announcements, including changes to the course schedule. And there are many tools on the site to communicate with each other, and with me.

## Plagiarism

Although team-work, and even co-authorship, is encouraged, plagiarism is strictly prohibited. You are responsible for making sure that none of your work is plagiarised. Be sure to cite work that you use, both direct quotations and paraphrased ideas. Any citation method that is tolerably clear is permitted, but if you'd like a good description of a citation scheme that works well in philosophy, look at <http://bit.ly/VDhRJ4>.

You are encouraged to discuss the course material, including assignments, with your classmates, but all written work that you hand in under your own name must be your own. If work is handed is as the work of two people, you are affirming that each person did a fair share of the work. (Note that when you're submitting work on Canvas, you have to each submit the paper, even if it is co-authored. That way Canvas knows that everyone has turned in work.)

You should also be familiar with the academic integrity policies of the College of Literature, Science & the Arts at the University of Michigan, which are available here: <http://www.lsa.umich.edu/academicintegrity/>. Violations of these policies will be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for Student Academic Affairs, and sanctioned with a course grade of F.

## Disability

The University of Michigan abides by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other applicable federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability, which mandate that reasonable accommodations be provided for qualified students with disabilities.

If you have a disability, and may require some type of instructional and/or examination accommodation, please contact me early in the semester. If you have not already done so, you will also need to register with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities. The office is located at G664 Haven Hall.
