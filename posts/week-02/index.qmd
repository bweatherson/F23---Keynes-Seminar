abstract: "Two of Keynes's most memorable essays. First, his (possibly unreliable) memoir of his time discussing philosophy as a student, with emphasis on Moore's lasting influence on him. Second, his upbeat assessment of the economic future, written just as Britain was ending a decade spent entirely in recession, and the Great Depression was about to start."

# Introduction

We're doing two pieces this week that are roughly the length of typical philosophy papers. And they both discuss, in their way, important philosophical questions. But as should be quickly clear from reading them, they are really nothing like you'd get reading _Philosophical Studies_ or something. That's deliberate on my part. One thing I want to think about over this seminar is how to write philosophically. In other classes you'll probably cover some things on how to do well within the genre of the contemporary philosophy journal article, and look at what we think are the standout instances of the form. I want to spend at least a little bit in this class reading and thinking outside that genre. So today we have a memoir, and a piece of popular rhetoric.

It's been very tempting in writing these notes to treat them as typical philosophy papers, and ask what's the thesis statement, what's the argument for that thesis, and so on. But I've tried to not just do that; while that approach has value, it might also lack something important. And maybe we can do something about that lack if we treat these papers on their own terms.

# My Early Beliefs

## Philosophical Background

It's widely, if not universally, believed that there was something like a philosophical revolution around Cambridge, around the start of the twentieth century, launching something that became known as analytic philosophy. Just what that revolution consisted in, just what made analytic philosophy different from what came before, and which things that came after are still part of analytic philosophy, are all matters of considerable dispute. But the following theses all have non-trivial amounts of support.

1. Analytic philosophy is the research program launched by the work of the German mathematician Gottlob Frege (1848-1925), the English philosophers Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) and G. E. Moore (1873-1959), and the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951). The latter three were all based in Cambridge for much of their life, and they all had important interactions with Keynes. Just how central Moore is to this story varies; some commentators stress Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein as central, others put Russell and Moore as the central characters.
2. Analytic philosophy is based in analysis (as the name suggests). That is, it takes as a central task the idea of breaking down notions into their constituent parts as a guide to philosophical understanding and progress. The central metaphor here is chemical analysis, not real analysis in mathematics, or psycho-analysis.
3. Analytic philosophy is launched by the (undeniable) revolution in logic that Frege started, and Russell continued/popularised, and the (somewhat more contentious) rejection of idealism by Moore and (later) Russell. _Idealism_ here is a very technical term; it refers to metaphysical theories that say the world is fundamentally mental, i.e., in some sense made of _ideas_. It's not a theory about _ideals_ or values, at least in the first instance. Just what idealism is, and whether there were good reasons to reject the things it might have been, remain matters of some dispute. But there is a linguistic claim that is completely beyond dispute: at the start of the twentieth century a huge proportion of philosophers in Britain would have described themselves as "idealists"; by the end almost none of them would have.
4. Analytic philosophy was primarily a revolution in philosophical work in logic, language, metaphysics, epistemology, and mind. It wasn't particularly concerned with ethics, and it certainly wasn't concerned with normative ethics. My (probably controversial) view is that one couldn't possibly say that ethics was part of the analytic revolution because then you'd have to explain what was distinctively about 20th century ethics that wasn't already there in Sidgwick and/or Marshall, and that's not really possible. But set that point aside; the history of analytic is not a field given to consensus, but that the early analytic folks made little significant contribution to moral and political philosophy is widely agreed.

All of this makes the role of _Principia Ethica_, the book at the centre of "My Early Beliefs", so mysterious. It is, obviously, by G. E. Moore, one of the canonical figures of analytic philosophy. And it is primarily about ethics. And, as we'll see, it is in large part about the uselessness of analysis in ethics.

_Principia Ethica_ isn't really why Moore is part of the analytic canon as such. He's there for two or three other things. One is his series of attacks on idealism; that's clearly central to the canon. Another is his defence of "common sense", and, relatedly, his (in)famously straightforward rejection of scepticism. The defence of common sense is related to the rejection of idealism. One of the most prominent uses of common sense is Moore's argument that McTaggert's idealist theory of time implies that it is false that Moore had breakfast that day before he had lunch. And Moore argues it is much more plausible that he had breakfast before he had lunch than it is that the premises of McTaggert's arguments are correct. (In fact he identifies the particular premise that he is sure is less plausible than the breakfast claim.) The third reason Moore is part of the analytic canon is that the term 'analysis', in this context, is one he popularised.

But none of this is ethics. _Principia Ethica_ is a widely read book in contemporary philosophy, even if it isn't always taken to be part of the analytic canon. But it's not read for it's _ethics_ strictly speaking. Rather, it's read for its _meta-ethics_. The ethics/meta-ethics distinction is blurry, but roughly meta-ethics is about the metaphysics of ethics (what is it for a moral claim to be true, if it is true), and about the theory of mind/language that is appropriate for ethics (what is it to accept/endorse a moral claim). The second most discussed feature of _Principia Ethica_ these days is Moore's conclusion, that moral thought and talk concerns a distinctive non-natural realm; moral properties really exist, and they are not identical to any natural property, and they are simple and unanalysable. The most discussed feature of _Principia Ethica_ is Moore's argument for that conclusion, because even people who don't accept (or frankly understand) what Moore's conclusion is, find his argument for that conclusion important. Indeed, if we were doing the history of this department we'd spend a lot of time on that argument. But we're not, because (at last) we can get to what moved Keynes.

The book ends with two chapters which heavily influenced Keynes, in opposite directions. The chapter on the Ideal I can't possibly describe better than Keynes does. I'll just note three things about the principle of organic unities. One is that it's basically what we'd now call value holism. The second, related point, is that it means that value is really not analysable. You don't understand the value of the whole by understanding the value of the parts. The third is that I don't really see what's valuable in the idea of an organic unity that isn't already implicit in the Walras/Jevons/Marshall marginalist theory of value. It seems to me implicit in marginalism that the fundamental bearers of value are whole states of affairs - indeed temporally extended states of affairs as Keynes notes when he presses for an intertemporal principle of organic unity.

The chapter on Ethics in Relation to Conduct in some ways influenced Keynes even more. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that he wrote the Treatise on Probability as a reaction/response to it. Moore held the following views, many of which Keynes would agree with.

1. Ethics is fundamentally about producing good states of affairs. In this respect he agrees with the 19th century consequentialists, Bentham, the Mills, Sidgwick, etc, though of course they did not think love and beauty were the main goods in the world.
2. Since we can't know what actions will actually produce goods, we should instead follow rules that will produce the most good over time.
3. But the world is too complicated, we can't even work out for ourselves which rules those are.
4. So we should fall back on conventional morality.

In "My Early Beliefs", Keynes says that they rejected step 1 of this. This is something that Woolf in particular objected to in Keynes's story. And honestly it's a little hard to believe that Keynes did not actually believe that producing good states of affairs (or at least good-sub-Moore states of affairs) was actually good. And Keynes bought step 2, _and step 3_. What he objected to was step 4. It would have somewhat crimped his lifestyle if he'd accepted it. (Just how promiscuous Keynes was when he was younger is a matter of some scholarly dispute, but a reasonable answer is _very_.) And he developed an entire theory of probability to say why 4 didn't follow from 3.
