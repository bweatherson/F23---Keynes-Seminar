Keynes on money

# two questions

Today’s class is going to be based around two big questions. 

1. What is money?
2. Why do people want money?

The answer to the second question might be obvious. As Homer Simpson once said, money can be exchanged for goods and services. But what we are interested in in here is the comparative question. Why do people want money as opposed to the goods and services?

## philosophical interest

There are two reasons these questions relate to questions of contemporary philosophical interest.

The first question relates to social metaphysics. Social media exist, the metaphysics of the social world; what kinds of things are universities, genders money, etc? And money seems like a good test case for various theories of social metaphysics.

The second question relates to K’s work on probability. There are hints in the text that the answer he gives to why people want money relates to his unorthodox theory of probability. i’m a little sceptical that that’s actually correct. But the answer he gives is interesting, even if it doesn’t end up being particularly connected to his probability theory.

## Keynes’s Interest

Keynes was interested in these questions about money for a related, but importantl, distinct reason. He thought that thinking about money showed how a certain kind of economic theory was mistaken.

Here is an argument that they can never be a failure of general demand. Demand is always demand for something rather than something else. Economic agents assumed to want more rather than less, and I kind of assumed to want more rather than less of everything. So when we want less of some particular thing, that can only be because there is something else we want more. So what looks like something in demand must really be a demand for something else. And so, there can be a slump in general demand.

This flies in the face of what anyone could see in the 1930s. And it’s important to note that there are two things that seem like exceptions to this idea that they cannot be a slump in demand for stuff in general. Maybe people want less houses, cars, holidays etc because they want one of the following two things: leisure, or money. The important thing about leisure and money is that they are not produced. A slump in demand for goods that are produced or services that are provided, and instead arise in demand for leisure or money would probably lead to a fall in employment.

It is somewhat implausible, that the great depression was the result of a sudden upsurge in demand for leisure. I’m told, but I’ve never seen this with my own eyes, that some conservative economists effectively say that it was. Leave that question to another day. The answer that Kay gives to why the great depression was so bad was that it was a huge urge in demand for money. When everyone wants money, there is a fall in demand for goods that are produced by workers and arise in demand for one very important good, namely, money, that is not, and that’s why employment falls. So if we can understand why demand for money might go up, maybe we can see why demand for labour will go down.

## Recent History of Economic Thought

One view that Kay was arguing against is what is called the quantity theory of money. The quantity theory of money says that the general price level is a function of the amount of money in the economy. The more money there is the higher prices up. In the strongest versions of the theory, that’s the full explanation of the general price level. Inflation, on this view, is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.

On the one hand, this does seem to do very well with explaining some of the really high bouts of inflation people have seen. In Germany in the 1920s there really was quite a lot of money going around. The government just kept on printing bank notes with more and more zeros at the end of them. 

On the other hand, it seems rather implausible that this is the full account of how inflation works. There was not a sudden upsurge in the amount of money In the economy in 2021. But inflation was as everyone remembers rather high.

More importantly, we know what happens when you try to manage inflation in just this way. This is what the Thatcher government did in the 1980s in Britain and it was a fairly dramatic failure. Part of the problem was, they could never get a sense of what money actually was over the course of the government. They kept changing their view on what did and didn’t count his money in order to try and rescue the theory they were working on, but none of them worked.

Even the fact that they could change should’ve been a sign that there was a problem here. At the time, the Bank of England put out, I believe seven different measures called M0 M1 etc to try to measure the amount of money there was in the economy on a bunch of different definitions. The differences included things like whether you counted the balances in peoples, checking accounts, or their credit card limits, as money that was available to them. There was, before trying to manage inflation this way, no really good reason to think that one of these choices, rather than the other would be the most important, as it turned out, none of them really did the trick. Sometimes, if you do nothing else to fight inflation, but just keep the amount of money down, the money that is around, will just move quicker and quicker to chase the goods and prices will go up anyway.

## Some distinctions

It’s very important to keep the difference between the following three things:

1. Money
2. Currency
3. Cash

When philosophers talk about money, they have an annoying tendency to focus purely on currency. Worse still, they tend to confuse currency with money. This isn’t right in modern economies, and it wasn’t right in traditional economies either.

Currency does have the advantage that it is relatively easy to identify, and even to define. In America, currency is pennies, nickels, dimes, and so on up to $100 bills. In other countries, the currency is somewhat different. (At least in most of the countries it is different; in Ecuador, for example, it is completely the same)

Money is not the same thing as currency. Money is what you keep in the bank. Money is what you Venmo to other people. You don’t keep currency in the bank. It’s true that you can go and hand currency over to the bank, and they will on occasion hand currency back to you. But there is no currency in the bank. That is your money. You don’t get the same currency back from the bank when you make a withdrawal. Things are even clearer with Venmo. no currency gets exchanged when you Venmo, some money to someone.

That’s how we go into understand money. It’s what you keep in the bank, and it’s what you used to pay off debts. Sometimes currency can be used for that. Sometimes the right way to pay off. The debt is to hand someone some coins or some pieces of green paper. Sometimes we even talk this way. On certain occasions if you ask me, do you have any money, it’s clear in context at what you mean to ask is whether I have any currency. But even that is not always the case. If we are at the vending machines downstairs, and you ask me if I have any money, a $20 bill is not going to help. On the other hand, a phone with Apple Pay installed will help. The phone, but not the $20 bill, is money in the cents relevant to that particular transaction. And what we are going be interested in is what kind of money is relevant to most transactions.

Cash is a little more complicated. I’m just going to not here, but in some circumstances, it makes sense to talk about keeping your money in cash, where that means keeping your money in a kind of account that can be readily drawn on. This might be a somewhat technical use of cash, but it’s still helpful to keep clear that, when people talk about cash in economic terms, they don’t always mean coins and pieces of green paper.

I don’t know the history, well enough to be at all shore on this, but I gather the distinction between money and currency is also of some historical significance. It’s possible that money was invented well before currency was. Currency is archaeologically important because coins have the pleasant habit of preserving quite well. So we know more about ancient currency that we know about a lot of other ancient things. 

But at least some historians think that money came to be well before currency did. Here’s how that could’ve happened. Consider a society, where all of the trading takes place at the temple. And when one trades, describes record how much was paid by one party. The payment need not take the form of handing over coins to the party delivering the goods. It could take the form of the scribes decreasing the number beside your name in the official records, and increasing the number beside the suppliers name. The tablets that the scribes keep will be the record of who has how much money. as I said, I don’t know the history, well enough to know how plausibility it is, but such societies existed, and that they predated the invention of currency. But they did exist, it’s an amusing way in which things like the Blockchain turn out to be reinventions of incredibly old technologies.

# Some Terminology

## Interest Rates

The big question in this chapter is what is the rate of interest. This might seem like a very odd question to ask, because in the modern world there are so many rates of interest. Is Keynes asking about the rate on

- Checking accounts
- Savings accounts
- Overnight treasuries
- 10 year treasuries
- Home mortgages
- Business loans
- Credit Cards

Or something else? Given the focus, i.e., the connection between interest rates and business investment, you might think that business loans are the things he cares about. But it's actually a bit mysterious which one it is.

In some ways the right answer is none of the above. Keynes is working with the assumption that money is 'barren', that it has no yield. But I can assure that money, i.e., overnight treasuries, have a quite nice yield right now. You can get 5.25% with ready access to money. Money actually has a yield, which complicates Keynes's story.

And the interest rate on a business loan is not just payment for the use of the capital, but also includes a premium for the probability that the loan won't actually get repaid.

I think what Keynes has in mind is something more like the difference between risk-free long-term and short-term lending. The 'difference' is to account for the fact that we're looking at the amount one must get paid to not hold money. And 10 year treasuries, unlike overnight treasuries, are not money. The 'risk-free' is because we're really not asking how much do banks require to compensate them for the fact that they might not get repaid; we're just asking how much do banks require to compensate them for the fact that they don't have the money while you don't.

Now here we get to a complication. Last I looked, the overnight treasury rate was 5.25%. And the 10 year treasury rate was around 4.5%. So the interest rate, in the sense I'm talking about here was negative 0.75%. It would be a very different chapter to chapter 17 if we had to explain negative interest rates.

So really (I think) the subject matter of this chapter should be read as trying to explain the difference between long term interest rates and expected values of short term interest rates, over that long term. I gather (though I do not understand the relevant calculations) that there is reason to think the market expectations of short-term interest rates over 10 years is 2-3%, so the 4.5% long term rate includes 100-200 basis points^[A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point in interest. It's a slightly annoying bit of terminology, but it avoids an ambiguity. If my credit card rate is 15%, and then it goes up by 10%, what's the new value? One answer is 25%, that's 15+10. Another is 16.5%, since 16.5 is 10% more than 15. To avoid this ambiguity, some people don't talk about rates moving by percentages at all, but by basis points. The two moves here would be a 150 point move, and a 1000 point move.] It's actually not that big a number compared to the amount of attention Keynes gives it, but then we're not in a slump right now.

## Elasticity

This is a very helpful notion that gets used twice over in this chapter. The idea is this. Sometimes when the price of something changes, our relationship to it changes. But it's important to know how fast the relationship changes. The elasticity measures that.

What kinds of relationships are at issue here? In this chapter there are basically two.

1. When the price of something rises, more people try to make/sell it? How much more gets made when the price rises by a certain amount? That's what the elasticity of supply measures.
2. When the price of an input to production rises, producers try to use something else. When the price of land goes up, the suppliers of housing start to build vertical apartment buildings; they substitute more expensive construction techniques for land. How quickly does that substitution happen? That's the elasticity of substitution.

Part of what's special about money is that it has incredibly low elasticity of supply and of substitution. The low elasticity of supply is sort of because we can't make any. That's a bit simplistic actually, but it's the rough idea. The low elasticity of substitution is because it's not actually easy to substitute something else for money in production.

The usual way you see elasticity get introduced in economics textbooks is the elasticity of demand. When the price of, say, apples changes, what happens to the demand for apples. This doesn't play as much of a role in this chapter, but it's the same idea.

## Own Rates of Interest

I'm not going to try to explain this part. It's a very strange passage, and I don't really think it helps a lot. It's annoying because it gets in the way of the much more interesting (to me at least!) bits towards the end of the chapter.

## Spot and Future

One last bit of terminology. The spot price for something is the price for buying it right now. It's what we'd call, outside of finance contexts, the price. The future price is the price of buying something for future delivery. I can buy, right now, oil to be delivered in 12 months time. That's the future price.

# Metaphysics of Money

## Keynes's Theory

This one is fairly simple to state, but a little harder to spell out.

> Money is the good with the highest surplus of liquidity premium over carrying costs.

Let's go through those two parts in reverse order.

The **carrying costs** of a good are the costs you incur by just having it. If the good is a box of apples, they go bad. If it's a large ice cube, it melts. If it's a house, you need to pay taxes and do maintenance. This would mostly be pretty intuitive if it weren't for one big problem.

At the start of the chapter, Keynes distinguishes the **yield** of a good from its capital costs. The yield is the revenue you earn from the good, the costs are the expenses you incur. In the real world, it's sometimes hard to tell apart a cost from a reduction in yield. Let's use a real world example to make this eaasier.

Let's say you buy a house and rent it out. There are two large sources of yield here: the rent, and the capital appreciation. There are any number of negatives though: the property taxes, the maintenance, perhaps the agency fees if you let through an agency, the broker fees when you sell, and so on. Which of these are _carrying costs_, and which of these are deductions from the _yield_. At the start of the chapter Keynes says, oh this doesn't matter because we're only going to care about the difference between yield and carrying costs, and for the purposes of that calculation, it won't matter whether you count maintenance as a carrying cost or a yield deduction. But despite him saying that, it isn't true! When he gets to the definition of money, carrying costs matter and yield doesn't.

I think in the house case it makes some amount of sense to say that the carrying costs are those costs you'd incur even if the house was just sitting there, and everything you pay in order to get the rent is a deduction from the yield. Clearly enough, the agency fees are deductions from the yield, not a carrying cost. And the property taxes are a carrying cost, not a deduction from the yield. The maintenance is tricky; some maintenance is always needed on houses, and some is caused by having renters. Worse still, some is *avoided* by having renters; there are distinctive things that go wrong in houses that are left unattended. It is all rather vague, and we're probably just going to have to live with the vagueness.

Onto liquidity. Consider two investors, each of whom has a million dollars to invest. Investor A buys a house for a million dollars, and rents it out. She expects to have something like the following balance sheet:

------------    ------------
 Income           $100,000
 Expenses          $30,000
 Profit            $70,000
 
Investor B keeps her money in overnight Treasury bonds. That means, she gets the going rate of interest the Treasury pays (currently 5.25%, though she expects that to fall some over the year), and can access her money at 24 hours notice or less. Since approximately none of her expenses have a payment due in under 24 hours (she pays everything on credit card so it's more like 45 days), that means her money is basically always at hand. She expects to have the following balance sheet for the year:

------------    ------------
 Income            $50,000
 Expenses                0
 Profit            $50,000

Now there is a very clear sense in which Investor A is doing better than Investor B, at least in expectation. Investor A gets $20,000 more. But Investor B has some benefits. If anything happens over the year, she can use her money to solve the problem, and Investor B can't. Think about things that can happen:

- Medical emergencies
- Housing emergencies
- Investment opportunities

and so on. If something happens and it would be really useful to have a large pile of money around to solve the problem (or exploit the opportunity), Investor B is right there. Investor A, on the other hand, is a bit stuck. True, she could sell the house. But that would (a) probably take more time than when the bills are due, (b) probably be at a loss, since it would be quite literally at fire-sale prices, and (c) involve a 6% commission.

If B thinks that one of those things is sufficiently likely, then it could be perfectly rational to take the safe $50,000 profit, rather than the likely $70,000 profit, with unknown and large downside.

This doesn't mean B would pass up any larger profit at all. After a while, if the difference was
